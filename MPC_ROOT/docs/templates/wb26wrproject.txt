exe_buildtool = Name of the tool to use to create executables (for example, C++-Linker or C-Linker)
librarian_objects = Object file list to use as input to the archiver/librarian
link_groups = A boolean template variable that determines if the GNU linker specific --start-group and --end-group options are used for the VxWorks Partial Image Linker

wrprj_macros = List of Macros for the BLD::Info|Macros section of the .wrproject.  Each element in this list will in turn be de-referenced (used as an MPC template variable name) to obtain its values.  LIBPATH and LIBS has special treatment here to get -L and -l prepended.
