Vortex OpenSplice is a full implementation of the **OMG DDS Standard** licensed under **Apache 2**. The DDS standard is used today across a large range of application domains ranging from autonomous vehicles, medical devices, robotic platforms, software defined networking, network switches, IoT Gateways, military and aerospace systems, Air Traffic Control and Management, to smart grids, smart farms, etc.

## Building

### POSIX / Linux

#### POSIX / Linux Minimal Build Required Tools

**NOTE**: The list of tools below is the minimal set required to build Vortex OpenSplice Community Edition without CORBA ORB collocation support. See the required tools section below for details of the additional dependencies to build Vortex OpenSplice Community Edition with support for sharing DDS types with a C++ or Java CORBA ORB.

The following tools should be installed and available on the machine executable / library search path:

- bash shell
- A suitable C / C++ compiler, e.g:
    - gcc - 3.2.x or above
    - Sun Studio - At this time only v12 of this compiler has been tested
- gmake - 3.80 or above.
- gawk - Any version is acceptable.
- flex - Any version is acceptable.
- bison - Version 2.7 or above is required.
- perl - Version 5.8 or above is required.
- gSOAP - This is optional. Version 2.7 or above is acceptable. If omitted the cmsoap services is not supported.
- Java SDK - This is optional. SDK (>1.6 < 1.9) are working java version > 1.8 does not work. If omitted no Java APIs or tools will be generated.
- Maven - This is optional. Version 3.0 or above is acceptable. If omitted no Java APIs or tools will be generated.
- Doxygen - This is optional. If omitted the documentation for the C# and I.S.O. C++ APIs will not be generated. Version 1.8 or greater is recommended for ideal results. (v6 of Vortex OpenSplice Community Edition onwards only)
- Protobuf - This is optional. Version 2.6.x is required. If omitted data types modeled in Google Protocol Buffers will not be supported
- Qt4 - Highly optional. Its only use is to build the iShapes demonstration application into the distribution, which can be used to illustrate DCPS use and verify interoperability. (v6 of Vortex OpenSplice Community Edition onwards only). See demos/iShapes/README.md.

#### POSIX / Linux Build with Optional CORBA Collocation Support Required Tools

In addition to the above dependencies the following may also be optionally installed and used to enable support for sharing data types with a CORBA ORB.

- **TAO** - See the installation instructions for how to install and configure the build environment.
    - Install and set TAO_ROOT to the directory that the TAO C++ ORB is installed in, before sourcing configure to enable C++ CORBA support.
- **JacORB** - See the installation instructions for how to install and configure the build environment.
    - Install and set JACORB_HOME to the directory that the JacORB Java ORB is installed in, before sourcing configure to enable Java CORBA support.

#### POSIX / Linux Steps to Build Vortex OpenSplice Community Edition from Source

- Set environment variables so that the above tools can be located:
    - Optionally set GSOAPHOME to the location of the gSOAP toolkit
    - Optionally set either or both TAO_ROOT or JACORB_HOME if you wish to build CORBA support. Otherwise: leave either or both unset. See above.
    - Optionally set JAVA_HOME - set to the directory that a SDK (>1.6 < 1.9) is installed in.
	- Optionally set M2_HOME - set to the directory that Apache Maven is installed in.
    - Optionally set PROTOBUF_HOME - set to the directory where Google Protocol Buffer is installed.
    - All other tools will be located from the machine $PATH
- Source the Vortex OpenSplice configure script to set-up your build environment. N.B. You must source this script each time you wish to configure a new shell as a build environment. The configuration choices are not persistent.
- Choose the target platform configuration.
- Invoke `make` to compile Vortex OpenSplice Community Edition

#### Windows Minimal Build Required Tools

**NOTE**: The below list of tools is the minimal set required to build Vortex OpenSplice Community Edition without CORBA ORB collocation support. See the required tools section below for details of the additional dependencies to build Vortex OpenSplice Community Edition with support for sharing DDS types with a C++ or Java CORBA ORB.

- Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 to Microsoft Visual Studio 2017
- cygwin - The latest available version is recommended. The following packages should be installed in addition to the recommended base selection:
  - gcc-core
  - gmake
  - perl
  - bison
  - flex
  - gawk
  - zip
  - unzip
  - doxygen (Optional - used for C# & ISO C++ API documentation)
- gSOAP - This is optional. Version 2.7 or above is acceptable.

- Qt4 - Highly optional. Its only use is to build the iShapes demonstration application into the distribution, which can be used to illustrate DCPS use and verify interoperability. (v6 of Vortex OpenSplice Community Edition onwards only). See demos/iShapes/README.md.

#### Windows Build with Optional CORBA Collocation Support Required Tools
In addition to the above dependencies the following may also be optionally installed and used to enable support for sharing data types with a CORBA ORB.

- TAO - See the installation instructions for how to install and configure the build environment.
  - Install and set TAO_ROOT to the directory that the TAO C++ ORB is installed in, before sourcing configure to enable C++ CORBA support.
- JacORB - See the installation instructions for how to install and configure the build environment.
  - Install and set JACORB_HOME to the directory that the JacORB Java ORB is installed in, before sourcing configure to enable Java CORBA support.

#### Windows Steps to build Vortex OpenSplice Community Edition from Source
- In a Cygwin shell set environment variables so that the required build tools can be located.
	- VS_HOME - set to the installation directory of Visual Studio 2008 or 2015.
	- WINDOWSSDKDIR - set to the location of the Windows SDK directory.
  - GSOAPHOME - set to the location of the gSOAP toolkit
	- Optionally set either or both TAO_ROOT or JACORB_HOME if you wish to build CORBA support. Otherwise: leave either or both unset. See above.
	- Optionally set JAVA_HOME - set to the directory that an Oracle SDK (>1.6) is installed in.
	- Optionally set QTDIR and PROTOBUF_HOME
	- All other tools will be located from the cygwin shell $PATH
- Unset TMP and TEMP (lower and upper case) otherwise you may encounter error 256 while building the Vortex OpenSplice Community Edition ISO C++ API. This is a known compatibility issue between Cygwin and Visual Studio. This can be done permanently by editing your /etc/profile and commenting out the setting of the variables.
- Source the Vortex OpenSplice configure script to set-up your build environment. N.B. You must source this script each time you wish to configure a new shell as a build environment. The configuration choices are not persistent.
- Choose the target platform configuration. N.B - 32/64 bit debug (dev) or release (release) builds are available.
	- Note that if you wish to build 'dev' and you wish to build C++ CORBA support then you must have installed a debug version of TAO. If you wish to build release then the TAO installed and indicated by the TAO_ROOT variable must also be release.
- Invoke `make` to build Vortex OpenSplice Community Edition
- Invoke `make install` to build a Vortex OpenSplice Community Edition Distribution

### Rebuilding the Vortex OpenSplice Community Edition Custom Libraries on POSIX / Linux
Binary distributions of Vortex OpenSplice Community Edition are shipped containing pre-built C++ and Java language binding libraries. These are known as the **Vortex OpenSplice Community Edition Custom Libraries**.

For maximum assurance of compatibility with your deployment platform the Vortex OpenSplice Community Edition Custom Libraries of a Vortex OpenSplice Community Edition binary distribution can be rebuilt. In this way you can be confident that these language binding libraries have matching linkage with the toolchain you plan to develop and deploy your application with.

#### Rebuilding the Standalone C++ Custom Libraries on POSIX / Linux
```
cd HDE/<<target_platform>>/custom_lib/
make
```

#### Rebuilding the CORBA Co-habitation C++ Custom Libraries on POSIX / Linux
- Configure the environment for the TAO C++ ORB as per the installation instructions.
- Change directory to the CORBA Co-habitation C++ Custom Libraries source directory in the binary Vortex OpenSplice Community Edition distribution.
- Make the directory.
- Copy the new library into place in he distribution.
```
cd HDE/<<target_platform>>/custom_lib/ccpp/
make
cp -f ./libdcpsccpp.so ../../lib/.
```

#### Rebuilding the Standalone C++ Custom Libraries on Windows
Open the Visual Studio solution file in HDE/<<target_platform>>/custom_lib and rebuild.

### Installing Google Protocol Buffer
Download the source from [https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases](https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases)

```
tar -xzf protobuf-2.6.1.tar.gz
cd protobuf-2.6.1
./configure
make
```
Add protoc to the PATH.

For Windows download a pre-compiled protoc version and put that in your PATH
```
export PROTOBUF_HOME=`pwd`
```
