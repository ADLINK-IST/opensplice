**What is DDS?**

“The Data Distribution Service (DDS™) is a middleware protocol and API standard for data-centric connectivity from the Object Management Group® (OMG®). It integrates the components of a system together, providing low-latency data connectivity, extreme reliability, and a scalable architecture that business and mission-critical Internet of Things (IoT) applications need.”

“The main goal of DDS is to share the right data at the right place at the right time, even between time-decoupled publishers and consumers. DDS implements global data space by carefully replicating relevant portions of the logically shared dataspace.”  DDS specification

**What is Simulink?**

“Simulink® is a block diagram environment for multidomain simulation and Model-Based Design. It supports system-level design, simulation, automatic code generation, and continuous test and verification of embedded systems. Simulink provides a graphical editor, customizable block libraries, and solvers for modeling and simulating dynamic systems. It is integrated with MATLAB®, enabling you to incorporate MATLAB algorithms into models and export simulation results to MATLAB for further analysis.”   Simulink Help
