# Try to find OpenSplice
# Once done this will define:
#
#  OpenSplice_FOUND - system has OpenSplice.
#  OpenSplice_INCLUDE_DIRS - the OpenSplice include directory.
#  OpenSplice_LIBRARIES - Link these to use OpenSplice.
#  OpenSplice_IDLGEN_BINARY - Binary for the IDL compiler.
#
# You need the environment variable $OSPL_HOME to be set to your OpenSplice
# installation directory.
# This script also includes the MacroOpenSplice.cmake script, which is useful
# for generating code from your idl.
