DDS provides many functional benefits that set it apart from other 
middleware technologies, but users often still have specific 
performance requirements for latency, throughput, CPU and network 
utilization. OpenSplice Enterprise provides the functional benefits 
of the technology whilst remaining committed to excellent 
performance. 

The flowcharts in this chapter show the decision criteria that may be 
applied in order to decide on the most appropriate test case, 
architectural mode, and networking protocol options for your specific 
use case and requirements.
