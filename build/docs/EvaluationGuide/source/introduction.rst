One of the key differentiators of OpenSplice Enterprise is that it 
provides a user with the ability to choose exactly how to deploy Data 
Distribution Service (DDS) applications, *i.e.* there are different DDS 
system architecture deployment modes and also different networking 
service protocols. This allows a user to maximize both *intra*-nodal 
and *inter*-nodal performance based on requirements specific to their 
own use case. When evaluating OpenSplice Enterprise it is very 
important to understand all of these features and benefits to ensure 
that the most appropriate combination is evaluated against your 
specific performance criteria. Once the performance figures have been 
observed the choice is usually clear. 

Every customer use case and set of requirements is different, so let 
us briefly guide you through how to best deploy OpenSplice Enterprise 
so that it meets and exceeds your expectations. Here we explain how 
easy it is to get started with OpenSplice Enterprise and observe the 
excellent performance and scalability it provides. OpenSplice 
Enterprise is even shipped with dedicated performance tests that the 
user can build and run easily.
