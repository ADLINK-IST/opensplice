The Node.js DCPS API provides users with Node.js classes to model DDS communication using JavaScript and pure DDS applications.

The Node.js DCPS API is a native JavaScript binding that supports DDS functionality. The language binding consists of Node.js classes and wrapper implementations of the C99 API (C API for DDS). It makes use of ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) JavaScript language features and leverages ease of use by providing a higher level of abstraction.

Please see :ref:`Limitations` for limitations of Node.js DDS API support.

**What is DDS?**

“The Data Distribution Service (DDS™) is a middleware protocol and API standard for data-centric connectivity from the Object Management Group® (OMG®). It integrates the components of a system together, providing low-latency data connectivity, extreme reliability, and a scalable architecture that business and mission-critical Internet of Things (IoT) applications need.”

“The main goal of DDS is to share the right data at the right place at the right time, even between time-decoupled publishers and consumers. DDS implements global data space by carefully replicating relevant portions of the logically shared dataspace.”  DDS specification
