About The Vortex Streams API Reference Guide
********************************************

The *Vortex Streams API Reference Guide* provides a detailed overview of the
Vortex OpenSplice Streams API. The Streams API is an add-on, built on the
Data Centric Public Subscribe (DCPS) paradigm that is implemented by
Vortex OpenSplice and standardized in the OMGâ€™s Data Distribution Service
Specification.

This Guide complements the Vortex OpenSplice *C++ Reference Guide*.

Intended Audience
*****************

The *Streams API Reference Guide* is intended to be used by C++
programmers who are using the OpenSplice Streams API to develop
applications. While not strictly required, it is assumed that the 
reader has a basic understanding of the DDS C++ API as detailed 
in the Vortex OpenSplice *C++ Reference Guide*.

Organisation
************

This *Guide* is organised in two parts.

The :ref:`Introduction <Introduction>` provides some background 
information about the features of the Streams API and how to use 
them. It also gives a broad overview of all entities and relations 
between entities in the Streams API.

The :ref:`API Reference <API Reference>` provides detailed 
descriptions of all of the classes and operations of the Streams API.
