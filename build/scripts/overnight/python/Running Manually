Running manually

If you wish to run an example manually then before running you must have OpenSplice installed and the example you wish to run should be built.

run the release.com / release.bat file and set up the environment with the following as appropriate to the platform on which you are running and the example you wish to run.

The following is assuming you are running on a build machine, running on your own machine then set the environment accordingly


EXRUNTYPE= sp  or shm
LOGDIR= < point to the location of the log directory - where logs will be copied to >

OSPL_URI= <point to the location of the ospl config file you wish to use - if not using the default>

#If running corba cpp example
TAO_ROOT=/home/dds/INSTALLED_FOR_DDS/TAO211_0-RedHat-EL62-gcc446-inline-32bit-120927-head  (as appropriate for machine)
ACE_ROOT=$TAO_ROOT

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$TAO_ROOT/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

#if running corba java example
JACORB_HOME=/home/dds/INSTALLED_FOR_DDS/JacORB-v2.3.1.0 (as appropriate for machine)

#if running dbmsconnect example (non-windows platforms)
ODBCHOME=/home/dds/INSTALLED_FOR_DDS/ODBC
ODBCINI=$ODBCHOME/etc/odbc.ini
ODBCINST=$ODBCHOME/etc/odbcinst.ini
ODBC_MSSQL_SERVER=10.1.0.189
ODBC_MYSQL_SERVER=10.1.0.191
ODBCSYSINI=$ODBCHOME/etc
LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$ODBCHOME/lib:.:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
ODBC_LIB_NAME="odbc"

 

On windows also set

PATH=c:\Python27;%PATH%

#If running dbmsconnect example

ODBC_LIB_NAME=odbc32

#if running protobuf example

PROTOBUF_HOME=C:\cygwin\home\dds\INSTALLED_FOR_DDS\protobuf-2.6.0

PROTOBUF_LIB_HOME=C:\cygwin\home\dds\INSTALLED_FOR_DDS\protobuf-2.6.0\src



To run a single example for a given language and a given type (e.g. standalone or corba)

python runExample.py -s <ExampleName> <lang> <type>

Where lang is from c, cpp, cs, isocpp, isocpp2, java, java5 and where type is from standalone or corba

Note: the use of standalone / corba will only be effective where applicable and is handled internally

 

ExampleName will be from
