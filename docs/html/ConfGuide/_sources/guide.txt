OpenSplice
**********

            OpenSplice DDS is highly configurable, even allowing the architecture of the
            DDS middleware to be chosen by the user at deployment time. OpenSplice DDS can
            be configured to run using a **shared memory** architecture, where both the
            DDS related administration (including the optional pluggable services) and DDS
            applications interface directly with shared memory. Alternatively, OpenSplice
            DDS also supports a **single process** architecture, where one or more DDS
            applications, together with the OpenSplice administration and services, can all be
            grouped into a single operating system process. Both deployment modes support a
            configurable and extensible set of services, providing functionality such as:

            networking - providing QoS-driven real-time networking based on multiple
                reliable multicast 'channels'

            durability - providing fault-tolerant storage for both real-time state data as well as
              persistent settings

            remote control and monitoring SOAP service - providing remote web-based
              access using the SOAP protocol from the OpenSplice Tuner tool

            dbms service - providing a connection between the real-time and the enterprise
              domain by bridging data from DDS to DBMS and vice versa

            Because of the pluggable architecture, the OpenSplice middleware
            can be easily configured on the fly by specifying which services to
            be used as well as specifying their optimal configuration for the
            application domain (networking parameters, durability levels, etc.).
            Typically, there are many nodes within a system.

            The OpenSplice middleware including its services can be configured
            by means of easy maintainable XML-file(s).

Domain
******

            The Domain service is responsible for creating and initialising the DDS database which is used by the
            administration to manage a specific DDS Domain on a computing node. Without this administration, no other
            service or application is able to participate in a DDS Domain.

            Once the administration has been initialised, the Domain service starts the set of pluggable services. The
            lifecycle of the started services is under control of the Domain service, which means it will monitor the health
            of all started services, take corrective actions if needed and stop the services when it is terminated.


            When a shutdown of the OpenSplice Domain service is requested, it will react by announcing the shutdown using the
            DDS administration. Applications will not be able to use DDS functionality anymore and services are requested
            to terminate elegantly. Once this has succeeded, the Domain service will destroy the administration and
            finally terminate itself.

- Child elements: Name, Id, Role, ServiceTerminatePeriod, SingleProcess, CPUAffinity, InProcessExceptionHandling, RetentionPeriod

Name
====

                    This element specifies the name of the instantiated DDS domain. In general, it is recommended to change
                    this name to a name that identifies the domain. If several different DDS domains are required to run
                    simultaneously, then they all need to have their own domain name.

- Format: string
- Default value: OpenSpliceV6
- Occurrences min-max: 1-1

Id
==

                    This element specifies the domain Id of the instantiated DDS domain. If several different DDS domains are required to run
                    simultaneously, then they all need to have their own unique domain Id.
                    Note - for maximum interoperability it is recommended that you only select a domain Id from the range 0 < n < 230. The domain Id
                    value is used by the DDSI2 service to derive values for the required network communiction endpoints and service reconfiguration is
                    required to use domain id values outside of this range.
                    Please see section 9.6.1 of the Real-time Publish-Subscribe Wire Protocol DDS Interoperability Wire Protocol specification (DDSI), v2.1, formal/2009-01-05 at
                    http://www.omg.org/spec/DDSI/2.1/ for further information.

Role
====

                This (optional) element specifies the role of the instantiated domain. For dynamic discovery, this role will
                be used to define the communication scope of instantiated domains on other nodes in the system. The purpose
                of specifying roles within the system is to 'overlay' the underlying physical network with a node's scope-of-interest
                that allows to bound topology discovery effort and related overhead in large scale (WAN) systems.

Lease
=====

                    The Lease parameters specify how the Domain service as well as the services started by the
                    Domain service must announce their liveliness in the DDS administration.

- Full path: /Domain/Lease
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1
- Child elements: ExpiryTime

ExpiryTime
----------

                    This element specifies the interval(in seconds) in which services have to announce their liveliness.

                    Every OpenSplice service including the Domain service itself has to announce its liveliness regularly.
                    This allows corrective actions to be taken when one of the services becomes non-responsive. This
                    element specifies the required interval. Decreasing the interval decreases the time in which
                    non-responsiveness of a service is detected, but leads to more processing. Increasing it has
                    the opposite effect.

- Full path: /Domain/Lease/ExpiryTime
- Default value: 10.0
- Occurrences min-max: 1-1
- Required attributes: update_factor

update_factor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

                        In case of a (temporary) high CPU load, the scheduling behaviour of the operating system might
                        affect the capability of a service to assert its liveliness 'on time'. The *update_factor* attribute
                        introduces some elasticity in this mechanism by making the services assert their liveliness more
                        often than required by the *ExpiryTime*. Services will report their liveliness every
                        *ExpiryTime* multiplied by this *update_factor*.

GeneralWatchdog
===============

                This element controls the default characteristics of the Watchdog thread for all services.
                Individual services may overrule this default in their service specific settings.
                Every service has its own Watchdog thread, that is responsible for automatically renewing the lease for that service.
                Services that do not renew their lease in time will loose the liveliness of all their writers

Scheduling
----------

                    This element specifies the type of OS scheduling class will be
                    used by the thread that announces its liveliness periodically.

- Full path: /Domain/GeneralWatchdog/Scheduling
- Occurrences min-max: 1-1

Priority
^^^^^^^^

                        This element specifies the thread priority that will be used by the
                        watchdog thread. Only priorities that are supported by the
                        underlying operating system can be assigned to this element.
                        The user may need special privileges from the underlying operating
                        system to be able to assign some of the privileged priorities.

- Full path: /Domain/GeneralWatchdog/Scheduling/Priority

- Optional attributes: priority_kind

priority_kind
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                                This attribute specifies whether the specified
                                Priority is a relative or absolute priority.

- Full path: /Domain/GeneralWatchdog/Scheduling/Priority/priority_kind
- Format: enumeration
- Default value: Relative

Class
^^^^^

                        This element specifies the thread scheduling class that will be used by
                        the watchdog thread. The user may need the appropriate privileges from
                        the underlying operating system to be able to assign some of the
                        privileged scheduling classes.

- Default value: Default
- Valid values: Timeshare, Realtime, Default
- Occurrences min-max: 1-1

ServiceTerminatePeriod
======================

                This element specifies the amount of time the Domain Service,
                when instructed to terminate, should wait for the other configured
                Services to terminate. When this element is configured to '0' the
                Domain service will terminate without any wait time at all. Be
                aware that without any wait time the deamon will use a hard kill
                on any lingering service that can not terminate fast enough.
                This may prevent graceful termination and thus leave applications
                that are still attached to the DDS domain in an undefined state.
                Consequently the '0' value should only be used when there is
                some form of process management on top of OpenSplice DDS.

- Full path: /Domain/ServiceTerminatePeriod
- Default value: 10.0
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

SingleProcess
=============

                    The SingleProcess element specifies whether the OpenSplice Domain and other
                      OpenSplice services and applications are intended to be all deployed within the
                      same process, known in OpenSplice as a single process.

                    Please note that the choice to use the single process deployment also implies
                      the use of heap memory for the OpenSplice database management instead of shared
                      memory that would be used otherwise. The heap memory is limited by the
                      Operating System, so the Database element under Domain does not take effect
                      when SingleProcess has a value of True.

                    There are two ways in which to deploy an OpenSplice DDS application as a
                      single process:

                    **Single Process Application** : The user starts an application as a
                      new process. In this case, the DDS create_participant operation will
                      implicitly start the OpenSplice Domain Service as a thread in the existing
                      application process. The OpenSplice Domain Service will then also implicitly
                      start all services specified in the configuration as threads within the same
                      process.
                    **Single Process Application Cluster** : This provides the option to
                      co-locate multiple DDS applications into a single process. This can be done
                      by creating application libraries rather than application executables that
                      can be linked into the single process in a similar way to how the DDS
                      middleware services are linked into the single process. The applications
                      that are created as libraries must be described using the Application
                      configuration attribute. These are started as threads within the existing
                      process by the Domain Service after all the DDS services that are specified
                      have been started as threads.

                    Please note that the Application elements specified under Domain will only
                      take effect when this SingleProcess attribute has a value
                      of true.

- Full path: /Domain/SingleProcess
- Format: boolean
- Default value: false
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

CPUAffinity
===========

          This (optional) element specifies a comma separated list of CPU numbers for the CPUs which opensplice, and its services should be restricted to use. (Supported on VxWorks kernel mode only)

- Full path: /Domain/CPUAffinity
- Format: string
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

InProcessExceptionHandling
==========================

           The InProcessExceptionHandling element determines whether a process that uses OpenSplice will
            handle exceptions by itself and try to clean up shared resources or not. If the process itself
            refrains from cleaning up its resources, the splice-daemon will attempt to clean up the application
            shared resources asynchronously. If the splice-daemon during clean-up determines that shared
            resources have been left in an inconsistent state by the application, it will
            terminate the middleware.

           Setting this option to false will make the middleware fail-safe. However, the downside of
            this approach is that there are cases in which the splice-daemon will decide to shut down the
            middleware, because it cannot determine with 100% certainty that shared resources are
            consistent (even if they are consistent in some cases). A potential approach could be to set this
            option to 'true' during development-phase and 'false' when application(s) have been deployed.

           By default this configuration item is set to true.

- Format: boolean
- Default value: true
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

Daemon
======

            Every domain is controlled by exactly one daemon: the Splice Daemon.
            The Splice Daemon configuration expects a root element named
            *OpenSplice/Daemon*. Within this root element, the Splice Daemon will
            look for several child-elements. Each of these child elements is
            listed and explained.

- Full path: /Domain/Daemon
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1
- Child elements: Locking

Locking
-------

                This element specifies the locking policy for the Splice Deamon
                process, indicating whether its pages should be locked in physical
                memory or not.

                On platforms with a virtual memory architecture, the operating
                system decides when to swap memory pages from internal memory to disk.
                This results in execution delays for the corresponding code because it
                has to be paged back into main memory. The element *Locking* can be
                used to avoid such swapping for the Splice Deamon. The user needs the
                appropriate privileges from the underlying operating system to be able
                to use this option.

ResendManager
-------------

                Every service has its own ResendManager thread, that is responsible for attempting to resend samples in the history queue of its writers.
                A writer that cannot successfully deliver a sample to a local service or application in the
                first attempt (for example because the application or service ran out of queue space) will store that sample in its own history queue,
                from which the Resend manager will periodically try to re-transmit it.

Heartbeat
---------

                    The Splice Daemon uses an heartbeat mechanism to monitor the
                    health of the remote domain services. This element allows
                    fine-tuning of this heartbeat mechanism.

                    Please note this heartbeat mechanism is similar to but not the
                    same as the service liveliness assertion.

ExpiryTime
^^^^^^^^^^

                        This element specifies the maximum amount of time(in seconds) in
                        which the Splice Daemon expects a new heartbeat of
                        remote domain services. This is obviously also the
                        same amount of time in which the Splice Daemon must
                        send a heartbeat itself.

                        Increasing this value will lead to less networking
                        traffic and overhead but also to less responsiveness with
                        respect to the liveliness of the Splice Daemon. Change
                        this value according to the need of your system with respect
                        to these aspects.

update_factor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                            In case of a (temporary) high CPU load, the scheduling
                            behaviour of the operating system might affect the
                            capability of the Splice Daemon to send its
                            heartbeat 'on time'. This attribute introduces some
                            elasticity in this mechanism by making the service
                            send its heartbeat more often then required by the
                            ExpiryTime.

                            The Splice Daemon will report its liveliness
                            every *ExpiryTime* multiplied by this

Database
========

                    This element contains information about the nodal administration (shared memory) to be used.

- Full path: /Domain/Database
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1
- Child elements: Size, Threshold, Address, Locking

Size
----

                        This element specifies the size of the shared memory segment holding the database. Change
                        this value if your system requires more memory than the default. Please note that the
                        operating system should be configured support the requested size. On most platforms you need
                        'root' privileges to set large sizes.

- Full path: /Domain/Database/Size
- Default value: 10485760
- Occurrences min-max: 1-1

Threshold
---------

                        This element specifies the threshold size used by OpenSplice DDS. Whenever there is less
                        free shared memory then indicated by the threshold then no new allocations will be allowed
                        within shared memory. Services are allowed to continue allocating shared memory until less then
                        50% of the threshold value is available. It is strongly discouraged to configure a threshold
                        value of less then the default value, but for some embedded systems it might be needed as
                        only limited memory is available.

- Default value: 1048576
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

Address
-------

                    This element specifies the start address where the
                    nodal shared administration is mapped into the virtual
                    memory for each process that attaches to the current Domain.
                    The possible values are platform dependent.

                    Change this value if the default address is already in
                    use, for example by another Domain Service or another
                    product.

Locking
-------

                    This element specifies the locking policy of the Database, indicating
                    whether to lock pages in physical memory or not.

                    With the virtual memory architecture, the operating system decides when
                    to swap memory pages from internal memory to disc. This results in execution
                    delays for the corresponding code because it has to be paged back into main
                    memory. The element *Locking* can be used to avoid such swapping for the
                    shared memory where the database resides. The user needs the appropriate
                    privileges from the underlying operating system to be able to use this option.

                    The possible values are:

                    
                    - **True**: lock the pages in memory.
                    - **False**: don't lock the pages in memory.
                    - **Default**: use the platform-dependent default value.

Listeners
=========

                    This element specifies policies for the thread that services the listeners that

Service
=======

                The Domain service is responsible for starting, monitoring and stopping the pluggable services.
                One Service element must be specified for every service that needs to be started by the Domain service.

name
----

                    This attribute specifies the name by which the corresponding service is
                    identified in the rest of the configuration file.

                    In the OpenSplice DDS configuration file, services and their settings
                    are identified by a name. When the Domain Service starts a particular
                    service, its corresponding name is passed. The service in question uses
                    this name in order to find its own configuration settings in the rest of
                    the configuration file. The name specified here must match the name
                    attribute of the main element of the corresponding service.

- Format: string
- Default value: durability
- Required: true

enabled
-------

                    This attribute indicates whether the service is actually started or not.

Command
-------

                    This element specifies the command to be executed in order to start the service.

                    OpenSplice DDS comes with a set of pluggable services. The Command element specifies
                    the name of the actual service executable (possibly including its path, but always
                    including its extension, e.g. '.exe' on the Windows platform). When no path is included,
                    the Domain Service will search the *PATH* environment variable for the corresponding
                    executable. Once located, it will be started as a separate process.

Configuration
-------------

                    This element allows overriding of the default URI (specified in the
                    *OSPL_URI* environment variable, or passed explicitly as command-
                    line parameter to the *ospl* executable) with the configuration
                    resource specified here.

                    When the Domain Service is started by the *ospl* executbale,
                    by default it passes on its own URI to the services that it starts.
                    This is valid when the configuration of the service is located in the
                    same resource file as the configuration of the Domain Service itself.
                    (This is a convenient situation in most cases).

                    If the configuration of the current service is located in a separate
                    resource file, a separate URI identifying that particular resource file
                    must be specified in this element.

                    This element specifies the type of OS scheduling class will be
                    used by the Domain service to create the service process. Services
                    can only be started within the scheduling classes that are

                        This element specifies the thread priority that the Domain Service will
                        assign to the current Service when it is started. Only priorities that
                        are supported by the underlying operating system can be assigned to this
                        element. The user may need special privileges from the underlying

Locking
-------

                    This element specifies the locking policy of the current Service
                    process, indicating whether pages should be locked in physical memory
                    or not.

                    On platforms with a virtual memory architecture, the operating
                    system decides when to swap memory pages from internal memory to disk.
                    This results in execution delays for the corresponding code because it
                    has to be paged back into main memory. The element *Locking* can be
                    used to avoid such swapping for the current Service. The user needs the
                    appropriate privileges from the underlying operating system to be able
                    to use this option.

- Full path: /Domain/Service/Locking
- Format: boolean
- Default value: false
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

FailureAction
-------------

                    This element specifies what action to take at the moment that the service seems
                    to have become non-responsive.

                    Each service reports its liveliness regularly using the DDS administration.
                    If the service fails to do so, the Domain service will assume the service has
                    become non-responsive. This element determines what action is taken
                    by the DomainService in case this happens.

                    The following actions are available:

                    
                        - **skip**: Ignore the non-responsiveness and continue.
                        - **kill**: End the service process by force.
                        - **restart**: End the service process by force and restart it.
                        - **systemhalt**:  End all OpenSplice services including the Domain service (for the current DDS Domain on this computing node).

Application
===========

                When in the single process deployment mode, the Domain service can deploy
                DDS applications by dynamically loading application shared libraries and
                starting threads within the existing process.

                **Note that Applications only take effect when the single process configuration is enabled by way of the SingleProcess element.**

Command
-------

                    Command is the name of both the entry point function to invoked and the name of the
                    shared library to be dynamically loaded into the process.  The signature of the entry
                    point function is the same as argc/argv usually seen with main.

                    For example, if Command is "HelloWorld", OpenSpliceDDS will attempt to load
                    "libHelloWorld.so" on Unix (or "HelloWorld.dll" on Windows) into the existing process
                    and then  invoke the "HelloWorld" entry point to start that DDS application.

                    If the name of the shared library does not have the same name as the entry point the
                    user is able to override the name of the library by using the Application's Library attribute

RetentionPeriod
===============

                    This element specifies how long the administration for unregistered instances is retained in both readers and the durability service before it is definitively removed.
                    (For the durability service this time is added to the service_cleanup_delay configured for each TopicQos.) By default unregistered instances are retained for 500 ms prior to removal,
                    to avoid the revival of 'forgotten' instances when receiving delayed samples written prior to the instance's unregistration.
                    This value should only be decreased when the expected lifetime of an instance is extremely short while the instance generation frequency is extremely high, to avoid running out of resources.
                    The value should be increased when you know you can expect out-of-order deliveries with a maximum delay higher than the currently configured RetentionPeriod.

                Client-durability is a feature that allows clients of this durability
                service to acquire historical data from a remote durability service
                without having to run their own durability service. This element
                controls the characteristics of the client-durability feature. When
                enabled, this durability server will be able to responds to requests
                for historical data from such clients.

deadlockDetection
-----------------

                This attribute drives whether the Watchdog will check for deadlocks and refrain
                from updating its lease and heartbeat in case one or more of its threads do not
                assert their liveliness. Typically this should not be enabled, but it can be
                helpful to ensure certain responsiveness of the durability service and the
                detection of potential deadlocks.

Network
=======

                    Applications need to be able to gain access to historical data in a system.
                    When the local DDS service gets connected to a remote DDS service by means
                    of the Networking service, (parts of) the historical data might not be
                    consistent between the local and remote Durability services. The Durability
                    service needs to be able to detect the other available Durability services
                    and exchange historical data with them to keep and/or restore consistency
                    in historical data between them.


                    The Network element provides handles to fine-tune the behavior of the
                    communication between Durability services on different computing nodes on
                    network level. These settings only apply when the Networking service is active.

latency_budget
--------------

                    This attribute controls the latency_budget QoS setting
                    that is used by the Durability service for its communication
                    with other Durability services.

                    It specfies the maximum acceptable delay (in seconds) from
                    the time the data is written until the data is insterted in the
                    cache of the receiving Durability service(s) and the receiver is
                    notified of the fact. The default value is zero, indicating the
                    delay should be minimized.

- Full path: /DurabilityService/Network/latency_budget

transport_priority
------------------

                    This attribute controls the transport priority QoS
                    setting that is used by the Durability service for its
                    communication with other Durability services.

                    It indicates the importance of the communication of the
                    Durability service with other Durability services in the
                    system. The transport priority specified here will be
                    interpreted by the Networking service and should be
                    used to differentiate the priority between communication
                    of user applications and communication of the Durability
                    service.

Heartbeat
---------

                    During startup and at runtime, the network topology can change
                    dynamically. This happens when OpenSplice services are started/stopped
                    or when a network cable is plugged in/out. The Durability services
                    need to keep data consistency in that environment. To detect newly
                    joining services as well as detecting nodes that are leaving, the
                    Durability service uses a hearbeat mechanism. This element allows
                    fine-tuning of this mechanism.


                    Please note this heartbeat mechanism is similar to but not the
                    same as the service liveliness assertion.

Priority
~~~~~~~~

                            This element specifies the thread priority that will be used

                            The user may need the appropriate privileges from the underlying
                            operating system to be able to assign some of the privileged

ExpiryTime
^^^^^^^^^^

                        This element specifies the maximum amount of time(in seconds) in
                        which the Durability service expects a new heartbeat of
                        other Durability services. This is obviously also the
                        same amount of time in which the Durability service must
                        send a heartbeat itself.

                        Increasing this value will lead to less networking
                        traffic and overhead but also to less responsiveness with
                        respect to the liveliness of a Durability service. Change
                        this value according to the need of your system with respect
                        to these aspects.

update_factor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                            In case of a (temporary) high CPU load, the scheduling
                            behaviour of the operating system might affect the
                            capability of the Durability service to send its
                            heartbeat 'on time'. This attribute introduces some
                            elasticity in this mechanism by making the service
                            send its heartbeat more often then required by the
                            ExpiryTime.

                            The Durability service will report its liveliness
                            every *ExpiryTime* multiplied by this
                            *update_factor*.

InitialDiscoveryPeriod
----------------------

                    To be able to ensure data consistency of historical data, the
                    Durability service needs to know which other Durability services
                    are available in the system. The value of this element determines
                    the amount of time the Durability service takes at startup to get
                    acquinted with all other Durability services in the system.

                    Increasing the value will increase the startup time of the
                    Durability service, but is required in larger domains where a lot
                    of network bandwidth is used.

Alignment
---------

                    The Durability service is responsible for keeping its local cache
                    consistent with the other available Durability caches in the
                    system. To do this, it needs to exchange data to recover from
                    inconsistencies. The exchange of durable data to restore
                    consistency is called alignment. This element allows fine-tuning
                    alignment behaviour of the Durability service.

                        needs to be consistent for all durability services in the
                        domain. In case there is no time alignment, the durability
                        service needs to align more data since to compensate possible
                        timing gaps between different nodes in the domain.

RequestCombinePeriod

                        When the Durability service detects an inconsistency with
                        another Durability service, it requests that service to align
                        it. The service that receives this request will restore
                        consistency by sending the requested information. In some
                        cases, the Durability service may receive alignment requests
                        from multiple Durability services for the same information
                        around the same moment in time. To reduce the processing and
                        networking load in that case, the Durability service is
                        capable of aligning multiple Durability services concurrently.

                        The RequestCombinePeriod has 2 child-elements: a setting
                        that is used when the current Durability Service is not yet
                        aligned with all others (*Initial*) and one for the period
                        after that (*Operational*). These values specify the maximum
                        amount of time the Durability service is allowed to wait with
                        alignment after an alignment request has been received.

                        Increasing the value will increase the amount of time in
                        which the Durability service restores from inconsistencies,
                        but will decrease the processing and network load in
                        case multiple Durability services need to resolve the
                        same data around the same time. Increasing the value
                        is useful in case OpenSplice is started at the same time
                        with more than two computing nodes.

Partition
^^^^^^^^^

                        This tag specified an inter durability communication
                        partition with specific qos settings. Alignment between
                        durability services managed through this partition.
                        In case multiple partitions are defined the partition
                        with the highest alignment_priority that can provide
                        the requested data will be used as data source.
                        By default (no Partition specified) the
                        durability services will use an internal partition
                        that inherits the default qos policies and has the
                        default alignment_priority.

                            select the preferred partition to align from. If
                            no alignment_priority is configured, the service

                The period (in seconds) to wait until an aligner is available in the domain.
                If an aligner does not become available within this period the entire federation
                will terminate and returns with error code 1 (recoverable error). Currently only
                values between 0.0 and 1.0 are supported, and all non-zero values are interpreted
                as infinite.

WaitForAttachment
-----------------

                    The Durability service depends on the Networking service for its
                    communication with other Durability services. Before it starts
                    communicating, it must make sure the Networking service is ready to
                    send the data. This element specifies what services must
                    be available and how long the Durability service must wait for them
                    to become available before sending any data.

maxWaitCount
^^^^^^^^^^^^

                        This attribute specifies the number of times the Durability
                        service checks if the services specified in the
                        *DurabilityService/Network/WaitForAttachment/ServiceName*
                        elements are available before sending any data. An error is
                        logged if one of the services still is unavailable afterwards.
                        The service will continue after that, but this indicates
                        a problem in the configuration and the service might not
                        function correctly anymore.

                        for a specific topic-partition combination. In a multinode
                        environment the name of the Networking service MUST be included

Persistent
==========

                Durable data is divided in transient and persistent data. Transient
                data must stay available for as long as at least one Durability
                service is available in the system. For persistent data it is
                the same, but that type of data must also outlive the downtime
                of the system. The Durability service stores the persistent data
                on permanent storage to realize this. This element can be used
                to fine-tune the behaviour of the Durability service concerning
                the persistent properties of the data.

                Note these elements are only available as part of the DDS
                persistence profile of OpenSplice.

StoreDirectory
--------------

                    This element determines the location where the persistent data will
                    be stored on disk. If this parameter is not configured,
                    the Durability service will not manage persistent data.

- Full path: /DurabilityService/Persistent/StoreDirectory
- Format: string
- Default value: /tmp/pstore
- Occurrences min-max: 1-1

StoreSessionTime
----------------

                    This element specifies the maximum session time (in seconds)
                    for the persistency thread. After this period of time, it makes
                    sure data is flushed to disk.

- Full path: /DurabilityService/Persistent/StoreSessionTime
- Default value: 20.0
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

StoreSleepTime
--------------

                    This element specifies the period of time (in seconds) the
                    persistency thread sleeps between two sessions. This allows
                    influencing the CPU load of the persistency thread.

                    In most use cases there is no need to change the default value.
                    Only in case the persistency thread takes up too much CPU time
                    so that it prevents other threads from progressing a non-zero value
                    should be used.

StoreMode
---------

                    This element specifies the plug-in that is used to store the
                    persistent data on disk. With "XML" mode, the service will store
                    persistent data in XML files. With "MMF", the service will store
                    persistent data in a Memory Mapped File that exactly represents
                    the memory that is being used by the persistent store.
                    With "KV" mode the service will store persistent data in a key-value
                    store using either sqlite of leveldb to store the data on disk.
                    !!! The "MMF" store is currently only implemented on linux !!!

SmpCount
--------

                    This element determines how many threads the durability
                    service will spawn to persist data to disk. Currently only supported for MMF
                    (memory mapped file) storemode.

KeyValueStore
-------------

                    This element specifies the key-value store mode parameters. The Storage element specifies
                    the which storage type is used to implement the key-value store. The storage type defaults
                    to Sqlite3 when the storage type is not specified. Using the optional StorageParameters
                    element parameters specific to the used storage implementation can be defined which are
                    passed to the selected storage implementation.
                    This element is only valid when the Persistent/StoreMode element is set to "KV".

- Valid values: sqlite3, leveldb
- Required: true

StorageParameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

                        This element specifies the configuration settings of the used storage implementation.
                        These configuration parameters are specific to the used storage which are documented
                        in the storage specific documentation. The configuration parameters are transparently
                        passed to the used storage. The StorageParameters consists of a list of configuration
                        items where each item is seperated by a ';'. Dependent on the storage an item can be
                        a single name or a name-value pair. In case of a name-value pair the name and the value
                        are seperated by an '=' character (name = value).

Compression
^^^^^^^^^^^

                        This element specifies compression settings for the key-value store.

                        Compression for the persistent store can be used to reduce disk I/O and lower disk
                        space usage at the cost of processing power required to compress and uncompress
                        the persistent data.

                        Compression is set at store creation time. Changing these settings after the store is
                        created will result in an error.

algorithm
~~~~~~~~~

                            This attribute specifies the compression algorithm that is used to store the persistent
                            data in the key-value store.

                            The lzf and snappy compression algorithms are built into the OpenSplice
                            installation. To use the zlib algorithm a shared library needs to be available on the
                            system, and it must be locatable by way of the current working directory, or via
                            LD_LIBRARY_PATH (on Unix systems) or PATH (on Windows systems).

- Full path: /DurabilityService/Persistent/KeyValueStore/Compression/algorithm

- Valid values: lzf, snappy, zlib
- Required: true

enabled
~~~~~~~

                            This attribute specifies whether the key-value store will apply compression for
                            storing persistent data to limit disk usage.

MemoryMappedFileStore
---------------------

                    This element specifies the memory mapped file store mode parameters. This
                    element is only valid when the Persistent/StoreMode element is set to "MMF".

- Occurrences min-max: 0-1
- Child elements: Size, Address

Size
^^^^

                          This element specifies the size of the memory mapped file used to
                          store persistent data. Change this value according to the size of
                          your persistent data. The file should be big enough to store:
                          
                          - all persistent data in your specified namespaces
                          - PLUS a potential backup for all persistent data in namespaces whose content may be replaced by persistent data from another master.
                          

                          As a rule of thumb, you could state that the persistent store should
                          be twice the size of your combined persistent data in your specified
                          namespaces. Please note that the operating system should be configured
                          to support the requested size.

                            If this value is not specified, the size of the persistent store will be
                            set to twice the size of the shared memory segment.

Address
^^^^^^^

                      This element specifies the start address where the
                      file is mapped into the virtual memory.
                      The possible values are platform dependent.

                      Change this value if the default address is already in
                      use, for example by another Domain Service or another
                      product.

                        If this value is not specified, the file will be mapped
                        just after the shared memory segment.

                Scalability of durable data is an issue in large systems. Keeping
                all historical data on each node may not be feasible. Often nodes are
                interested in a small part of the total system data, on one hand
                driven by application interest, on the other hand driven by
                fault-tolerance (the need for replicates). This setting controls
                which historical data is managed by this Durability service
                (both transient and persistent).

- Occurrences min-max: 1-1

NameSpace
---------

                    A namespace describes a dependency between data in two or
                    more partitions by means of a partition expression. The
                    dependency specifies that the data within one of the
                    partitions has no right to exist separately from the data in
                    the other partition(s). Namespaces determine which data must
                    be managed by the Durability service. Data that does not
                    match any of the namespaces, is ignored by the Durability service.

Partition
^^^^^^^^^

                        This element specifies a partition expression that
                        matches the namespace. A namespace consists of a set of
                        partition expressions. Together they determine the
                        partitions that belong to the namespace. Make sure the
                        different namespaces do not have an overlap in partitions.
                        The default configuration has one namespace containing all
                        partitions. A partition may contain the
                        wildcards '*' to match any number of characters and '?'
                        to match one single character.

PartitionTopic
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

                        This element specifies a partition-topic expression that
                        matches the namespace. A group expression is a
                        combination of a partition- and a topic expression. The
                        notation is 'partition.topic'. A namespace consists of
                        a set of partition-topic expressions. Together they
                        determine the partition-topic combinations that belong
                        to the namespace. Make sure the different namespaces do
                        not have an overlap in expressions. The default
                        configuration has one namespace containing all
                        combinations (*.*). A partition-topic expression may
                        contain the wildcards '*' to match any number of
                        characters and '?' to match one single character.

Policy
------

                    A namespace describes a dependency between data in two or
                    more partitions by means of a partition expression. The
                    dependency specifies that the data within one of the
                    partitions has no right to exist separately from the data in
                    the other partition(s). Namespaces determine which data must
                    be managed by the Durability service. Data that does not
                    match any of the namespaces, is ignored by the Durability service.

                    A template specifies behaviour for a namespace. It
                    matches a namespace name with an expression that may contain
                    wildcards, thereby allowing dynamic configuration for
                    namespaces. The order in which templates are specified is
                    important, as the first matching template
                    will be the one that is selected for a namespace.

Merge
^^^^^

            This tag specifies the merge policy applicable for a
            specific namespace. The following merge policy values are
            applicable:
            
            - Ignore - No alignment will take place. This is also the default value if not specified.
            - Merge - Existing data will remain and data from others will be aligned.
            - Delete - Existing data is removed.
            - Replace - Existing data is removed and data from others will be aligned.
            - Catchup - Existing data that is not available from others is removed, and data
                          that is added or changed by others will made available.
            

            Note that the Replace and Catchup merge policies result in the same data set, but their
            instance states may differ after the merge policy has completed. In the Replace merge policy
            all instances present both before and after the merge transitioned through NOT_ALIVE_DISPOSED
            and end up as NEW instances with changes to the instance generation counters. In the Catchup
            merge policy the instance state of the instances that are not changed will remain untouched.

            The scope attribute specifies for which role(s) the mergepolicy will be applied.
            A scope may contain the wildcards '*' to match any number of characters and '?' to match one
            single character.

durability
^^^^^^^^^^

                        This element specifies how the durability service
                        manages the data within the NameSpace. The original
                        durability of the data (determined by the DataWriter
                        that wrote it) can be 'weakened' (Persistent > Transient
                        > Transient_local). This is useful to improve
                        resource usage of the durability service in the
                        situation where resource usage is more important
                        then fault-tolerance. This parameter cannot be used
                        to increase the original durability of samples.

                        In case the value of this parameter is larger then
                        the value a sample was published with, the sample will
                        be handled as specified in the DataWriter durability
                        QoS.

                        
                         - **Persistent**: Data is maximally handled as persistent. In practice this means a sample is handled exactly as specified in the DataWriter durability QoS that wrote it.
                         - **Transient**: A sample is maximally handled as if it were published with a transient durability QoS.
                         - **Transient_Local**: Data is maximally handled as if it were published with a transient_local durability QoS.
                         - **Durable**: Convenience value that behaves equal to Persistent.

aligner
^^^^^^^

                    This element determines if the durability service will provide
                    historical data to other durability services.

- Full path: /DurabilityService/NameSpaces/Policy/aligner
- Format: boolean

- Required: true

alignee
^^^^^^^

                        This element determines how the durability service manages
                        the data that matches the namespace. Scalability of durable
                        data is an issue in large systems. Keeping all historical data
                        on each node may not be feasible. Often nodes are interested
                        in a small part of the total system data. They are driven
                        by both performance (boot time, memory usage, network load,
                        CPU load) and fault tolerance (the need for replicates).

                        The durability service provides the following
                        mechanisms to request and provide historical data:
                        
                        - **Initial**: The durability service requests historical data at startup and caches it locally. Historical data will be available relatively fast for new local data readers and the system is more fault-tolerant. However, caching of historical data requires a relatively large amount of resources and a long boot time.
                        - **Lazy**: The Durability service caches historical data after local application interest arises for the first time and a remote Durability service aligns the first data reader. Historical data is available relatively slow for the first data reader, but for every new data reader it is relatively fast. The caching resources are only used when local interest in the data arises, so it only requires resources if there is actual local interest. However, this method provides no fault-tolerance for the domain, because the local Durability service is only partly a replica and is not able to provide historical data to remote Durability service and/or remote data readers.
                        - **On_Request**: The Durability service will not cache historical data, but will align each separate DataReader on a request basis (in the situation where it calls wait_for_historical_data). Each new DataReader that wants historical data therefore leads to a new alignment action. This is a good setting to limit the amount of resources used on the node, but will potentially lead to more network traffic. This method provides no fault-tolerance for the domain.

delayedAlignment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

                [BETA] This element determines if the durability allows delayed alignment of initial data.
                This can be usefull for systems where there can be late-joining nodes with a persistent
                dataset, which by default are then not inserted.
                When this option is enabled, durability will only insert a persistent set from a late joining
                node when no writers have been created in the partitions matched by the namespace!

- Full path: /DurabilityService/NameSpaces/Policy/delayedAlignment
- Format: boolean
- Default value: False
- Required: false

equalityCheck
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

                This element specifies whether or not the durability service should compare its
                current data set with the data set of its aligner before applying the merge policy.
                If this option is enabled the aligner will align its data sets only in case there is
                a difference between his data sets and the data sets of this durability service.
                By default this option is NOT enabled, so data is always aligned even if there is no
                difference between data sets.


                This option applies to all merge policies except for the IGNORE and DELETE merge
                policy.


                **NOTE** Enabling this option may lead to less alignment data at the expense of
                processing power required to calculate hashes to compare the data sets. It is recommended
                to enable this option only for large data sets that do not change often. If this option is
                enabled for data sets that change often then chances of set equality are small, while the
                penalty to calculate hashes still exists.

Filters
-------

                    Filters are expressions that are applied when historical
                    data is requested from another durability service. By using
                    filters the amount of alignment data between durability
                    services can be reduced.


                    Different filters can be specified for different partition-topic
                    combinations using the &lt;Filter&gt;-elements.


                    **NOTE** A side effect can occur when filters are
                    used in combination with the ability to align data.
                    In case a node that has retrieved a subset of historical data
                    using filters becomes the aligner to other nodes at some
                    point in time, then only this subset will be aligned to the other
                    nodes.

Filter
^^^^^^

                      This element specifies the filter expression that is used when
                      historical data is requested. The &lt;PartitionTopic&gt;-child
                      elements specify the partition-topic combinations to which the
                      filter expression is applied.


                      If no filter is defined for a particular partition-topic then all data will be
                      aligned for this partition-topic combination.
                      If multiple filters are defined then the first one that matches will be applied.

content
~~~~~~~

                      This attribute specifies the expression that is used for filtering.
                      The expression is a string that is used as-is without any parameters.
                      The filter expression is essentially the where-clauses of an sql expression.
                      When data is requested for matching partition-topics only the data
                      that matches the filter expression will be aligned. The
                      content attribute defaults to the empty string, which means that
                      no filter is applied at all.


                      The following escape sequence can be used in expressions: &amp;lt;
                      (less than), &amp;gt; (greater than), &amp;quot; (double quote)
                      &amp;apos; (apostrophe) and &amp;amp; (ampersand).


                      Examples of expressions are:
                      
                        - x=1 or x=2
                        - (id&amp;lt;10) and (name=&quot;test&quot;)
                      

                      If an invalid filter expression is provided an error will be logged

SNetworkService
***************

            When communication endpoints are located on different computing nodes,
            the data produced using the local DDS service must be communicated to
            the remote DDS service and the other way around. The Networking service
            provides a bridge between the local DDS service and a network interface.
            Multiple Networking services can exist next to each other; each serving
            one (or more) physical network interface(s). The Secure Networking service
            is responsible for forwarding data to the network and for receiving data
            from the network. It can be configured to distinguish multiple
            communication channels with different QoS policies assigned to be able
            to schedule sending and receival of specific messages to provide optimal
            performance for a specific application domain.

NetworkInterfaceAddress
-----------------------

                    This element specifies which network interface card should be used.
                    Every Secure Networking service is bound to only one network interface card
                    (NIC). The card can be uniquely identified by its corresponding
                    IP address or by its symbolic name (e.g. eth0). If the
                    value "first available" is entered here, the OpenSplice
                    middleware will try to look up an interface that has
                    the required capabilities.

forced
^^^^^^

                    This attribute specifies whether only the selected NetworkInterfaceAddress should be used or others can be used too.
                    
                        - false - Specifies that the NetworkInterfaceAddress is first used but when not available another, when available, is used. (default).
                        - true - Specifies that only the selected NetworkInterfaceAddress can be used.

- Full path: /SNetworkService/General/NetworkInterfaceAddress/forced
- Format: boolean
- Default value: false
- Required: false

ipv6
^^^^

                    This attribute specifies whether IPv6 should be used for communication.
                    
                        - false - specifies that IPv4 should be used (default).
                        - true - Specifies that IPv6 should be used.
                     

                     This setting will be overriden & ignored if the element NetworkInterfaceAddress has an explicit value
                     that is unequivocally either an IPv4 or IPv6 address. This attribute is therefore only
                     optionally required to specify IPv6 communication when special values like "first available" or
                     an interface name are used instead of IP addresses.

bind
^^^^

                        Specifies the bind strategy to be used by the networking
                        service for its sockets.
                        
                            - any - Specifies that the service should bind to the wildcard-address (INADDR_ANY) (default).
                            - strict - Specifies that the service should bind to the NetworkingInterfaceAddress.

- Full path: /SNetworkService/General/NetworkInterfaceAddress/bind
- Format: enumeration
- Default value: any
- Valid values: any, strict
- Required: false

allowReuse
^^^^^^^^^^

                        By default the networking service will bind to a port
                        allowing other services to bind to the same port as well
                        (so reuse of the port is allowed). By setting this option
                        to 'false', the port is bound exclusively (SO_REUSEADDR
                        disabled).
                         
                             - true - Ports can be reused (SO_REUSEADDR enabled) (default).
                             - false - Ports are bound exclusively.

- Full path: /SNetworkService/General/NetworkInterfaceAddress/allowReuse
- Format: boolean
- Default value: true
- Required: false

EnableMulticastLoopback
-----------------------
EnableMulticastLoopback specifies whether the secure networking service will allow
          IP multicast packets within the node to be visible to all secure networking participants in the node,
          including itself. It must be TRUE for intra-node multicast communications,
          but if a node runs only a single OpenSplice secure networking service and does not host
          any other networking-capable programs, it may be set to FALSE for improved performance.

LegacyCompression
-----------------

                     This element specifies if compression is applied after of before fragmentations.
                     When set to TRUE compression is applied after fragmentation which is provided for
                     backward compatibility. When set to FALSE compression is applied before fragmentation.
                     The default value is TRUE.

Reconnection
------------

                     This element specifies the desired secure networking-behavior with respect to the
                     validity of restoring lost connectivity with remote nodes.
                     Here 'lost connectivity' means a prolonged inability to communicate with a known
                     and still active remote node (typically because of network-issues)
                     that has resulted in such a node being declared 'dead' either by the topology-discovery or
                     lost-reliability being detected by a reliable channel's reactivity-checking mechanism.
                     If automatic reconnection is allowed, communication channels with the now-reachable-again node will be restored,
                     even though reliable data might have been lost during the disconnection period.

allowed
^^^^^^^

                    This attribute specifies whether the network service must

                    has already been seen before but has been disconnected
                    for a while.
                    
                        - false - Specifies that the network service must NOT resume communication. (default).

Partitioning
============

                The OpenSplice Secure Networking service is capable of leveraging
                the network's multicast and routing capabilities. If some a-priori
                knowledge about the participating
                nodes and their topic and partition interest is available, then the
                secure networking services in the system can be explicitly instructed to use
                specific unicast or multicast addresses for its networking traffic.
                This is done by means of so-called network partitions

                A network partition is defined by one or more unicast, multicast
                of broadcast IP addresses. Any secure networking service that is started
                will read the network partition settings and, if applicable, join
                the required multicast groups. For every sample distributed by the
                secure networking service, both its partition and topic name will be
                inspected. In combination with a set of network partition mapping rules,
                the service will determine to which network partition the sample is
                written. The mapping rules are configurable as well.

                Using
                networking configuration, nodes can be disconnected from any
                networking partition. If a node is connected via a low speed
                interface, it is not capable of receiving high volume data. If
                the DCPS partitioning is designed carefully, high volume data is
                published into a specific partition, which on its turn is mapped
                onto a specific networking partition, which on its turn is only
                connected to those nodes that are capable of handling high volume data.

GlobalPartition
---------------

                    This element specifies the global or default secure networking partition.

- Full path: /SNetworkService/Partitioning/GlobalPartition
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1
- Required attributes: Address
- Optional attributes: SecurityProfile, MulticastTimeToLive

Address
^^^^^^^

                        The global
                        networking partition transports data that is either meant
                        to be global, like discovery heartbeats, or that is not
                        mapped onto any other networking partition. The address is a list
                        of one or more unicast, multicast or broadcast addresses. If more
                        than one address is specified, then the different
                        addresses are separated by a colon (,) semicolon (;) or space ( ).
                        Samples for the global partition will be sent to all addresses
                        that are specified in this list of addresses. To specify the
                        default broadcast address, use the expression "broadcast".
                        Addresses can be entered as dotted decimal notation or as the
                        symbolic hostname, in which case the middleware will try to resolve
                        the corresponding IP address.

SecurityProfile
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

                     In the context of secure networking, the GlobalPartition element provides
                     support for the attribute SecurityProfile. The attribute is referencing a security
                     profile declared in the context of the Security element.
                     If the given reference is invalid, the global partition configuration is invalid. In this
                     case, the partition will be blocked to prevent unwanted information leaks. A
                     configuration error message will be logged to the ospl-error.log file. If the
                     security feature has been enabled, but no profile is declared, then the NULL profile is
                     used by default: this means that no security is added to the transport

Address
~~~~~~~

                            The address is a list
                            of one or more unicast, multicast or broadcast addresses. If more
                            than one address is specified, then the different
                            addresses are separated by a colon (,) semicolon (;) or space ( ).
                            Samples for this network partition will be sent to all addresses
                            that are specified in this list of addresses. To specify the
                            default broadcast address, use the expression "broadcast".
                            Addresses can be entered as dotted decimal notation or as the
                            symbolic hostname, in which case the middleware will try to

Connected
~~~~~~~~~

                            A node can choose to be not connected to a networking
                            partition by setting the Connected attribute.

                            If a node is connected to a networking partition,
                            it will join the corresponding multicast group and
                            it will receive data distributed over the partition.
                            If it is not connected, data distributed over the
                            partition will not reach the node but will be
                            filtered by the networking interface or multicast
                            enabled switches.

Compression
~~~~~~~~~~~

                            This attribute specifies if networking will apply compression to limit bandwidth
                            for a specific network partition. This provides great flexibility as network
                            partition are dynamically bind to logical partitions. Compression is performed
                            before fragmentation of the messages. To provide backward compatibility the option
                            LegacyCompression (see General options) can be set to provide compression after
                            fragmentation. The following compression values are allowed:
                            
                                - false - No compression is applied. This is also the default value if not specified.

SecurityProfile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                       In the context of secure networking, the NetworkPartition element provides
                       support for the attribute SecurityProfile. The attribute is referencing a security
                       profile declared in the context of the Security element.
                       If the given reference is invalid, the network partition configuration is invalid. In
                       this case the partition will be blocked to prevent unwanted information leaks. A
                       configuration error message will be logged to the ospl-error.log file. If the
                       security feature has been enabled but no profile is declared, the NULL profile will be
                       used by default.
                       The ordering of network partition declarations in the OSPL configuration file must
                       be the same for all nodes within the OpenSplice domain. If certain nodes shall not
                       use one of the network partitions, the network partition in question must be declared
                       as connected="false". In this case the declared security profile would not be
                       evaluated or initialized, and the associated secret cipher keys need not to be defined
                       for the OpenSplice node in question.

                            if it matches. The PartitionExpression and
                            TopicExpression are allowed to contain a '*' wildcard,
                            meaning that anything matches. An exact match is
                            considered better than a wildcard match. If a DCPS messages

                        and a partition-topic combination.

                        In order to give networking partitions a meaning in the context
                        of DCPS, mappings from DCPS partitions and topics onto networking
                        partitions should be defined. Networking allows for a set of

                Declaring this element in the OSPL configuration file will activate the secure
                networking feature. Without any additional security settings, all network partitions
                of the node would use the NULL cipher encoding. If confidentiality and integrity is
                required for a network partition, the network partition must be associated with a
                security profile

- Occurrences min-max: 0-1
- Optional attributes: enabled

enabled
-------

                        This is an optional attribute. If not defined it defaults to true and all network
                        partitions, if not specified otherwise, will be encoded using the NULL cipher. The
                        NULL cipher does not provide for any level of integrity or confidentiality, but
                        message items will be sent unencrypted.
                        In case of enabled="false" the security feature will not be activated, and the
                        node acts like any other OpenSplice node not being security aware. Security profiles
                        defined in the configuration file will not take effect, but will cause the system to log
                        warnings.

- Full path: /SNetworkService/Security/enabled
- Format: boolean
- Default value: false
- Required: false

SecurityProfile
---------------

                   This element defines the security profile which can be applied to one or more
                   network partitions. This element is optional.

- Full path: /SNetworkService/Security/SecurityProfile
- Occurrences min-max: 0-*
- Required attributes: Name, Cipher, CipherKey

Name
^^^^

                       This is a mandatory attribute. The name must be unique for all Security Profiles
                       being declared. If the name is not specified, the security profile will be ignored as it
                       cannot be referenced anyway.

- Full path: /SNetworkService/Security/SecurityProfile/Name
- Format: string
- Default value: aSecurityProfile
- Required: true

Cipher
^^^^^^

                        This is a mandatory attribute. Depending on the declared cipher, the cipher key must
                        have a specific length, 128 bits, 192 bits, 256 bits or none at all. The following
                        case-insensitive values are supported by the current implementation:
                        
                            - aes128, implements AES cipher with 128 bit cipher-key (16 Bytes, 32 hexadecimal characters). This cipher will occupy 34 bytes of each UDP packet being sent.
                            - aes192, implements the AES cipher with 192 bit cipher-key (24 Bytes, 48 hexadecimal characters). This cipher will occupy 34 bytes of each UDP packet being sent.
                            - aes256, implements the AES cipher with 256 bit cipher-key (32 Bytes, 64 hexadecimal characters. This cipher will occupy 34 bytes of each UDP packet being sent.
                            - blowfish, implements the Blowfish cipher with 128 bit cipher-key (16 Bytes, 32 hexadecimal characters). This cipher will occupy 26 bytes of each UDP packet being sent.
                            - null, implements the NULL cipher. The only cipher that does not require a cipher-key. This cipher will occupy 4 bytes of each UDP packet being sent.
                        

                        All ciphers except for the NULL cipher are combined with SHA1 to achieve data
                        integrity. Also, the rsa- prefix can be added to the ciphers. In this case, digital
                        signatures using RSA will be available.

- Full path: /SNetworkService/Security/SecurityProfile/Cipher
- Format: string
- Default value: null
- Valid values: aes128, aes192, aes256, blowfish, null, rsa-aes128, rsa-aes192, rsa-aes256, rsa-blowfish, rsa-null
- Required: true

CipherKey
^^^^^^^^^

                        The CipherKey attribute is used to define the secret key required by the declared
                        cipher. The value can be a URI referencing an external file containing the secret key,
                        or the secret key can be defined in-place directly as a string value. The key must be
                        defined as a hexadecimal string, each character representing 4 bits of the key, for
                        example. 1ABC represents the 16 bit key 0001 1010 1011 1100. The key must
                        not follow a well-known pattern and must match exactly the key length required by
                        the chosen cipher. In case of malformed cipher-keys, the security profile in question
                        will be marked as invalid. Moreover, each network partition referring to the invalid
                        Security Profile will not be operational and thus traffic will be blocked to prevent
                        information leaks.
                        As all OpenSplice applications require read access to the XML configuration file,
                        for security reasons it is recommended to store the secret key in an external file in
                        the file system, referenced by the URI in the configuration file. The file must be
                        protected against read and write access from other users on the host. Verify that
                        access rights are not given to any other user or group on the host.

                        Alternatively, storing the secret key in-place in the XML configuration file will give
                        read/write access to all DDS applications joining the same OpenSplice node.
                        Because of this, the 'in-place' method is strongly discouraged.

- Required: true

AccessControl
-------------

                    The optional AccessControl element defines settings for access control enforcement
                    and which access control module shall be used.

- Full path: /SNetworkService/Security/AccessControl
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1
- Optional attributes: enabled, policy

enabled
^^^^^^^

                        The access control feature will be activated when enabled="true"

- Full path: /SNetworkService/Security/AccessControl/enabled
- Format: boolean
- Default value: false
- Required: false

policy
^^^^^^

                        The policy attribute references a file containing the access control policy.

- Full path: /SNetworkService/Security/AccessControl/policy
- Format: string
- Default value: ""
- Required: false

AccessControlModule
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

                        The AccessControlModule element defines which access control module will be
                        used. More than one module may be defined. All defined and enabled modules will
                        be used to determine if access should be granted.

- Full path: /SNetworkService/Security/AccessControl/AccessControlModule
- Occurrences min-max: 0-*
- Optional attributes: enabled, type

enabled
~~~~~~~

                            The module specified in the type attribute is used to evaluate access control rules
                            when enabled="true".

- Full path: /SNetworkService/Security/AccessControl/AccessControlModule/enabled
- Format: boolean
- Default value: true
- Required: false

type
~~~~

                            The type attribute defines the access control model type. Currently, OpenSplice only
                            supports mandatory access control, accordingly the only valid value for this
                            attribute is "MAC".

- Full path: /SNetworkService/Security/AccessControl/AccessControlModule/type
- Format: string
- Default value: none
- Required: false

Authentication
--------------

                     The optional Authentication element defines whether additional sender
                     authorization shall be performed. Enabling Authentication requires that a cipher,
                     including RSA (such as rsa-aes256), is used.

- Full path: /SNetworkService/Security/Authentication
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1
- Optional attributes: enabled

enabled
^^^^^^^

                         Authentication is performed when enabled is set to true.

- Full path: /SNetworkService/Security/Authentication/enabled
- Format: boolean
- Default value: true
- Required: false

X509Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

                        The X509Authentication element defines where keys and certificates required for
                        X509 authentication may be found.

- Full path: /SNetworkService/Security/Authentication/X509Authentication
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1
- Child elements: TrustedCertificates

Credentials
~~~~~~~~~~~

                           The Credentials element is an optional element. If it is missing, then the node does
                           not sign messages (in other words, does not send credentials).

- Full path: /SNetworkService/Security/Authentication/X509Authentication/Credentials
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1
- Child elements: Key, Cert

Key
+++

                           The Key element references the file containing the key.

                           It is recommended that the absolute path is used. A relative path
                           will be interpreted relative to the directory from which the
                           OpenSplice daemon is started.

Cert
++++

                           The Cert element references the file containing the certificate.

                           It is recommended that the absolute path is used. A relative path
                           will be interpreted relative to the directory from which the
                           OpenSplice daemon is started.

TrustedCertificates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                        The TrustedCertificates element references a file containing the trusted certificates.

                        It is recommended that the absolute path is used. A relative path
                        will be interpreted relative to the directory from which the
                        OpenSplice daemon is started.

Channels
========

                This element is used to group a set of Channels.

                The set of channels define the behaviour of the 'network' concerning
                aspects as priority, reliability and latency budget. By configuring
                a set of channels, the Networking service is able to function as a
                'scheduler' for the network bandwidth. It achieves this by using the
                application-defined DDS QoS policies of the data to select the most
                appropriate channel to send the data.

- Full path: /SNetworkService/Channels
- Occurrences min-max: 1-1
- Child elements: AllowedPorts

Channel
-------

                    This element specifies all properties of an individual Channel.

                    The Networking service will make sure messages with a higher
                    priority precede messages with a lower priority and it uses the
                    latency budget to assemble multiple messages into one UDP packet
                    where possible, to optimize the bandwidth usage. Of course, its
                    performance depends heavily on the compatbility of the configured
                    channels with the used DDS QoS policies of the applications.

- Full path: /SNetworkService/Channels/Channel
- Occurrences min-max: 1-42
- Child elements: PortNr, FragmentSize, Resolution, AdminQueueSize, CompressionBufferSize, CompressionThreshold, AllowedPorts
- Required attributes: name, reliable, enabled
- Optional attributes: default, priority

name
^^^^

                        The name uniquely identifies the channel.

- Full path: /SNetworkService/Channels/Channel/name
- Format: string
- Default value: aChannel
- Required: true

reliable
^^^^^^^^

                        If this attribute is set to true, the channel sends all messages reliably.
                        If not, data is sent only once (fire-and-forget).

                        The specific channel a message is written into depends on the attached
                        quality of service. Once a message has arrived in a channel, it will be
                        transported with the quality of service attached to the channel. If the
                        reliable attribute happens to be set to true, the message will be sent
                        over the network using a reliability protocol.

- Full path: /SNetworkService/Channels/Channel/reliable
- Format: boolean
- Default value: false
- Required: true

default
^^^^^^^

                        This attribute indicates whether the channel is selected as the
                        default channel in case no channel offers the quality of service
                        requested by a message.

                        The networking channels should be configured corresponding
                        to the quality of service settings that are expected to be
                        requested by the applications. It might happen, however,
                        that none of the available channels meets the requested
                        quality of service for a specific message. In that case,
                        the message will be written into the default channel.

                        Note that only one channel is allowed to have this attribute
                        set to true

- Full path: /SNetworkService/Channels/Channel/default
- Format: boolean
- Default value: false
- Required: false

enabled
^^^^^^^

                        This attribute toggles a channel on or off. Toggling a
                        channel between enabled and disabled is a quick alternative
                        for commenting out the corresponding lines in the configuration
                        file.

- Full path: /SNetworkService/Channels/Channel/enabled
- Format: boolean
- Default value: false
- Required: true

priority
^^^^^^^^

                        This attribute sets the transport priority of the channel.
                        Messages sent to the network have a transport_priority
                        quality of service value. Selection of a networking channel
                        is based on the priority requested by the message and the
                        priority offered by the channel. The priority settings
                        of the different channels divide the priority range
                        into intervals. Within a channel, messages are sorted in
                        order of priority.

- Full path: /SNetworkService/Channels/Channel/priority
- Format: integer
- Default value: 0
- Required: false

PortNr
^^^^^^

                        This element specifies the port number used by the Channel.
                        Messages for the channel are sent to the port number given.
                        Each channel needs its own unique port number. Please note
                        that 'reliable' channels use a second port, which is the
                        specified PortNr + 1.

- Full path: /SNetworkService/Channels/Channel/PortNr
- Format: integer
- Default value: 53400
- Occurrences min-max: 1-1

FragmentSize
^^^^^^^^^^^^

                        The networking module will fragment large message into smaller
                        fragments with size **FragmentSize**. These fragments
                        are sent as datagrams to the UDP stack. OS-settings determine
                        the maximum datagram size.

- Full path: /SNetworkService/Channels/Channel/FragmentSize
- Default value: 1300
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

Resolution
^^^^^^^^^^

                        The resolution indicates the number of milliseconds that
                        this channel sleeps between two consecutive resend or
                        packing actions. Latency budget values are truncated to a
                        multiple of "Resolution" milliseconds.

                        It is considered good practice to specify the ThrottleTreshold consistently throughout
                        the system.

- Full path: /SNetworkService/Channels/Channel/Resolution
- Format: integer
- Default value: 10
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

AdminQueueSize
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

                        For reliable channels the receiving side needs to keep the sending
                        side informed about the received data and the received control messages.

                        This is done by means of an "AdminQueue". This setting determines the
                        size of this queue, and it must be greater than the maximum number of reliable
                        messages send or received during each "Resolution" milliseconds.

- Full path: /SNetworkService/Channels/Channel/AdminQueueSize
- Format: integer
- Default value: 4000
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

CompressionBufferSize
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

                        When compression on messages is enabled then the CompressionBufferSize specifies the initial
                        size of the compression/decompression buffer. The compression buffer is used to store the messages
                        before they are compressed and send on the network. The decompression buffer is used to decompress
                        the received compressed messages. Note that the actual size of these buffers may be increased when
                        needed.

- Full path: /SNetworkService/Channels/Channel/CompressionBufferSize
- Format: integer
- Default value: 131072
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

CompressionThreshold
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

                        When compression on messages is enabled then the CompressionThreshold provides a threshold
                        to start compressing the accumulated data and sending the compressed data on the network.
                        The CompressionThreshold is used to estimate the size of the compressed messages.

- Full path: /SNetworkService/Channels/Channel/CompressionThreshold

- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

Sending
^^^^^^^

                        This element describes all properties for the transmitting side
                        of the Channel.

CrcCheck
~~~~~~~~

                       In order to protect OpenSplice network packets from malicious attack the CrcCheck(cyclic redundancy check) configuration item has been added.
                       CRCs are specifically designed to protect against common types of errors on communication channels.
                       When enabled the integrity of delivered network packets from one DDS process to another is assured.
                       There is a small performance cost using this feature due to the addtional overhead of carrying out the crc calculation.

                       When the sending side is enabled the network packet will contain a valid crc field.

QueueSize
~~~~~~~~~

                            This element specifies the number of messages the networking queue
                            can contain.
                            Messages sent to the network are written into the networking queue.
                            The networking service will read from this queue. If this
                            queue is full, the writer writing into the queue is suspended
                            and will retry until success. Note that a full networking queue is
                            a symptom of an improperly designed system.

MaxBurstSize
~~~~~~~~~~~~

ThrottleLimit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                            Throttling will enable you to further limit (below MaxBurstSize) the amount of data that is
                            sent every Resolution interval. This happens if one of the receiving nodes in the network
                            indicates that it has trouble processing all incoming data. This value is the lower boundary
                            of the range over which the throttling can adapt the limit. If this value is set to the same
                            value (or higher) as MaxBurstSize throttling is disabled.
                            The ThrottleLimit value is not allowed be smaller than the FragmentSize. If a lower value is
                            provided, then the value of FragmentSize is used as ThrottleLimit.

ThrottleThreshold
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                            This is the number of unprocessed network fragments that a node will store before it will inform
                            the other nodes in the network that it has trouble processing the incoming data. Those other nodes
                            can use this information to adjust their throttle values, effectively reducing the amount of incoming
                            data in case of a temporary overflow, and increasing again when the node is able to catch up.

                            It is considered good practice to specify the ThrottleTreshold consistently throughout
                            the system.

DiffServField
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                        This element describes the DiffServ setting the channel will apply to the networking messages.
                        This parameter determines the value of the  diffserv field of the IP version 4 packets send
                        on this channel which allows QoS setting to be applied to the network traffic send on this channel.
                        


                        Windows platform support for setting the diffserv field is dependent on the OS version.
                        For Windows versions XP SP2 and 2003 to use the diffserv field the following parameter should
                        be added to the register:
                        


                        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\TcpIp\\Parameters\\DisableUserTOSSetting
                        


                        The type of this parameter is a DWORD and it's value should be set to 0 to allow setting of the diffserv field.
                        


                        For Windows version 7 or higher a new API (qWAVE) has been introduced For these platforms the specified
                        diffserv value is mapped to one of the support traffic types. The mapping is as follows:
                        1-8 background traffic; 9-40 excellent traffic; 41-55 audio/video traffic; 56 voice traffic; 57-63 control traffic.
                        When OpenSplice is run without Administrative priveleges then only the diffserv value of 0, 8, 40 or 56 is allowed.

CrcCheck
~~~~~~~~

                       In order to protect OpenSplice network packets from malicious attack the CrcCheck(cyclic redundancy check) configuration item has been added.
                       CRCs are specifically designed to protect against common types of errors on communication channels.
                       When enabled the integrity of delivered network packets from one DDS process to another is assured.
                       There is a small performance cost using this feature due to the addtional overhead of carrying out the crc calculation.

                       When the receiving side is enabled only network packets that contain a valid crc field are accepted.

PacketRetentionPeriod
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                            This element specifies the number of milliseconds received packets are retained by the network
                            service for its so-called "reliability-under-publisher-crash" extended reliability
                            protocol. This protocol ensures that a consistent or aligned data-set is received by all
                            alive (receiving) nodes, even though some nodes might not have received some
                            packets at the moment a sending node disappears (for whatever reason). The
                            protocol implies that each node retains sufficient received data so that it can be
                            (re-)distributed if a publishing node disappears before all receiving nodes are
                            "up-to-date". When the PacketRetentionPeriod element is set to 0 (the default
                            value), the alignment amongst receiving nodes will not occur. To activate the
                            extended realibility protocol, this setting must be configured to a time period that
                            exceeds the worst-case death-detection time as configured for the discovery
                            protocol of the set of distributed networking services in the system.

ReliabilityRecoveryPeriod
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                            This element specifies a timeout period (in milliseconds) for the alignment phase of the extended
                            reliability protocol. It only has an effect when the related
                            PacketRetentionperiod is set to a non-zero value. After the specified
                            reliabilityRecoveryPeriod timeout, any data retained for the purpose of
                            alignment of receiving nodes (following the disappearance or crash of a publishing
                            node) will be discarded. The value of this timeout period must be sufficient to allow
                            for the worst-case alignment-time of any "missed" data by individual receiving
                            nodes following the disappearance of a sending node in the system.

AllowedPorts
^^^^^^^^^^^^

                AllowedPorts specifies the port numbers available for the network service to be used by the
                reliable network channels. The network channel is configured with a unique port number. However
                the reliable network channels require a second port number to provide the reliable communication
                service. For this second port number each reliable network channel will select a free port from
                the AllowedPorts.
                When the AllowedPorts is not specified for a particular channel then the default AllowedPorts which
                is configured on the Channels element is used. When also the default AllowedPorts is not specified
                each reliable network channel will first try to use the configured portNr + 1 as the second port or
                when this port number is already in use will determine a port number dynamically.
                The AllowedPorts is a list of entries where an entry is a port number or a port number range.
                When the AllowedPorts contains more than one entry then these entries must be seperated by a
                comma (,). A port number range consists of the lower and the upper bound of the port number range,
                where the lower and the upper bound are seperated by a minus (-).

Discovery
=========

                This element is used to configure the various parameters of the Discovery Channel,
                which is used to discover all relevant participating entities in the current Domain.
                The purpose of the discovery process is to build-up and maintain a notion of all
                relevant active nodes within the domain.  The relevance of discovered remote nodes
                can be defined statically (by definition of the so-called Global Partition) and/or
                can be dynamically expanded and maintained by the dynamic-discovery process driven
                by the node's Role and Scope.

Scope
-----

                    This attribute controls the dynamic discovery behaviour of this node within the current Domain.
                    If it is not set, dynamic discovery will be disabled and the networking service will only
                    communicate with nodes that can be reached through the predefined Global Partition. If the Scope
                    attribute is specified, dynamic discovery is enabled and the networking service will be able to
                    communicate with all nodes in the system that have a Role that matches the Scope expression.
                    The Scope expression can contain a comma separated list of wild-card role-expressions. If the
                    role of any  discovered node matches any of the wild-card expressions, the remote node is
                    considered a match and will become part of the communication reach (i.e. the Global Partition)
                    of the current domain.

DiffServField
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

                        This element describes the DiffServ setting the channel will apply to the networking messages.
                        This parameter determines the value of the  diffserv field of the IP version 4 packets send
                        on this channel which allows QoS setting to be applied to the network traffic send on this channel.
                        


                        Windows platform support for setting the diffserv field is dependent on the OS version.
                        For Windows versions XP SP2 and 2003 to use the diffserv field the following parameter should
                        be added to the register:
                        


                        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\TcpIp\\Parameters\\DisableUserTOSSetting
                        


                        The type of this parameter is a DWORD and it's value should be set to 0 to allow setting of the diffserv field.
                        


                        For Windows version 7 or higher a new API (qWAVE) has been introduced For these platforms the specified
                        diffserv value is mapped to one of the support traffic types. The mapping is as follows:
                        1-8 background traffic; 9-40 excellent traffic; 41-55 audio/video traffic; 56 voice traffic; 57-63 control traffic.
                        When OpenSplice is run without Administrative priveleges then only the diffserv value of 0, 8, 40 or 56 is allowed.

CrcCheck
^^^^^^^^

                       In order to protect OpenSplice network packets from malicious attack the CrcCheck(cyclic redundancy check) configuration item has been added.
                       CRCs are specifically designed to protect against common types of errors on communication channels.
                       When enabled the integrity of delivered network packets from one DDS process to another is assured.
                       There is a small performance cost using this feature due to the addtional overhead of carrying out the crc calculation.

                       When the sending side is enabled the network packet will contain a valid crc field.

Compression
===========

                      This group of attributes specifies a compression method to
                      use within the service in partitions where it is enabled. The
                      networking service includes (depending on platform) implementations
                      of zlib, lzf and snappy. Others may be implemented by writing a
                      dynamically-loadable library and configuring it here. See the
                      OpenSplice release notes for details of how to write such a
                      library.

                      It is imperative that all nodes exchanging compressed data
                      have the same configuration in this section.

                        ospl_comp_lzf_init and ospl_comp_snappy_init but for convenience
                        they may be specified here as as zlib, lzf or snappy.

NetworkService
**************

            When communication endpoints are located on different computing nodes,
            the data produced using the local DDS service must be communicated to
            the remote DDS service and the other way around. The Networking service
            provides a bridge between the local DDS service and a network interface.
            Multiple Networking services can exist next to each other; each serving
            one (or more) physical network interface(s). The Networking service
            is responsible for forwarding data to the network and for receiving data
            from the network. It can be configured to distinguish multiple
            communication channels with different QoS policies assigned to be able
            to schedule sending and receival of specific messages to provide optimal
            performance for a specific application domain.

NetworkInterfaceAddress
-----------------------

                    This element specifies which network interface card should be used.
                    Every Networking service is bound to only one network interface card
                    (NIC). The card can be uniquely identified by its corresponding
                    IP address or by its symbolic name (e.g. eth0). If the
                    value "first available" is entered here, the OpenSplice
                    middleware will try to look up an interface that has
                    the required capabilities.

- Occurrences min-max: 0-1
- Optional attributes: forced, ipv6, bind, allowReuse

forced
^^^^^^

                    This attribute specifies whether only the selected NetworkInterfaceAddress should be used or others can be used too.
                    
                        - false - Specifies that the NetworkInterfaceAddress is first used but when not available another, when available, is used. (default).
                        - true - Specifies that only the selected NetworkInterfaceAddress can be used.

- Full path: /NetworkService/General/NetworkInterfaceAddress/forced
- Format: boolean
- Default value: false
- Required: false

ipv6
^^^^

                    This attribute specifies whether IPv6 should be used for communication.
                    
                        - false - specifies that IPv4 should be used (default).
                        - true - Specifies that IPv6 should be used.
                     

                     This setting will be overriden & ignored if the element NetworkInterfaceAddress has an explicit value
                     that is unequivocally either an IPv4 or IPv6 address. This attribute is therefore only
                     optionally required to specify IPv6 communication when special values like "first available" or
                     an interface name are used instead of IP addresses.

- Full path: /NetworkService/General/NetworkInterfaceAddress/ipv6
- Format: boolean
- Default value: false
- Required: false

bind
^^^^

                        Specifies the bind strategy to be used by the networking
                        service for its sockets.
                        
                            - any - Specifies that the service should bind to the wildcard-address (INADDR_ANY) (default).
                            - strict - Specifies that the service should bind to the NetworkingInterfaceAddress.

- Full path: /NetworkService/General/NetworkInterfaceAddress/bind
- Format: enumeration
- Default value: any
- Valid values: any, strict
- Required: false

allowReuse
^^^^^^^^^^

                        By default the networking service will bind to a port
                        allowing other services to bind to the same port as well
                        (so reuse of the port is allowed). By setting this option
                        to 'false', the port is bound exclusively (SO_REUSEADDR
                        disabled).
                         
                             - true - Ports can be reused (SO_REUSEADDR enabled) (default).
                             - false - Ports are bound exclusively.

- Full path: /NetworkService/General/NetworkInterfaceAddress/allowReuse
- Format: boolean
- Default value: true
- Required: false

EnableMulticastLoopback
-----------------------
EnableMulticastLoopback specifies whether the networking service will allow
          IP multicast packets within the node to be visible to all networking participants in the node,
          including itself. It must be TRUE for intra-node multicast communications,
          but if a node runs only a single OpenSplice networking service and does not host
          any other networking-capable programs, it may be set to FALSE for improved performance.

- Full path: /NetworkService/General/EnableMulticastLoopback
- Format: boolean
- Default value: True
- Valid values: True, False
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

LegacyCompression
-----------------

                     This element specifies if compression is applied after of before fragmentations.
                     When set to TRUE compression is applied after fragmentation which is provided for
                     backward compatibility. When set to FALSE compression is applied before fragmentation.
                     The default value is TRUE.

- Default value: True
- Valid values: True, False
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

Reconnection
------------

                     This element specifies the desired networking-behavior with respect to the
                     validity of restoring lost connectivity with remote nodes.
                     Here 'lost connectivity' means a prolonged inability to communicate with a known
                     and still active remote node (typically because of network-issues)
                     that has resulted in such a node being declared 'dead' either by the topology-discovery or
                     lost-reliability being detected by a reliable channel's reactivity-checking mechanism.
                     If automatic reconnection is allowed, communication channels with the now-reachable-again node will be restored,
                     even though reliable data might have been lost during the disconnection period.

allowed
^^^^^^^

                    This attribute specifies whether the network service must
                    resume communication with an other network service when it
                    has already been seen before but has been disconnected
                    for a while.
                    
                        - false - Specifies that the network service must NOT resume communication. (default).
                        - true -  Specifies that the network service must resume communication.

Partitioning
============

                The OpenSplice Networking service is capable of leveraging
                the network's multicast and routing capabilities. If some a-priori
                knowledge about the participating
                nodes and their topic and partition interest is available, then the
                networking services in the system can be explicitly instructed to use
                specific unicast or multicast addresses for its networking traffic.
                This is done by means of so-called network partitions

                A network partition is defined by one or more unicast, multicast
                of broadcast IP addresses. Any networking service that is started
                will read the network partition settings and, if applicable, join
                the required multicast groups. For every sample distributed by the
                networking service, both its partition and topic name will be
                inspected. In combination with a set of network partition mapping rules,
                the service will determine to which network partition the sample is
                written. The mapping rules are configurable as well.

                Using
                networking configuration, nodes can be disconnected from any
                networking partition. If a node is connected via a low speed
                interface, it is not capable of receiving high volume data. If
                the DCPS partitioning is designed carefully, high volume data is
                published into a specific partition, which on its turn is mapped
                onto a specific networking partition, which on its turn is only
                connected to those nodes that are capable of handling high volume data.

                    This element specifies the global or default networking partition.

- Full path: /NetworkService/Partitioning/GlobalPartition

- Required attributes: Address
- Optional attributes: MulticastTimeToLive

Address
^^^^^^^

                        The global
                        networking partition transports data that is either meant
                        to be global, like discovery heartbeats, or that is not
                        mapped onto any other networking partition. The address is a list
                        of one or more unicast, multicast or broadcast addresses. If more
                        than one address is specified, then the different
                        addresses are separated by a colon (,) semicolon (;) or space ( ).
                        Samples for the global partition will be sent to all addresses
                        that are specified in this list of addresses. To specify the
                        default broadcast address, use the expression "broadcast".
                        Addresses can be entered as dotted decimal notation or as the
                        symbolic hostname, in which case the middleware will try to resolve
                        the corresponding IP address.

Address
~~~~~~~

                            The address is a list
                            of one or more unicast, multicast or broadcast addresses. If more
                            than one address is specified, then the different
                            addresses are separated by a colon (,) semicolon (;) or space ( ).
                            Samples for this network partition will be sent to all addresses
                            that are specified in this list of addresses. To specify the
                            default broadcast address, use the expression "broadcast".
                            Addresses can be entered as dotted decimal notation or as the
                            symbolic hostname, in which case the middleware will try to
                            resolve the corresponding IP address.

Connected
~~~~~~~~~

                            A node can choose to be not connected to a networking
                            partition by setting the Connected attribute.

                            If a node is connected to a networking partition,
                            it will join the corresponding multicast group and
                            it will receive data distributed over the partition.
                            If it is not connected, data distributed over the
                            partition will not reach the node but will be
                            filtered by the networking interface or multicast
                            enabled switches.

Compression
~~~~~~~~~~~

                            This attribute specifies if networking will apply compression to limit bandwidth
                            for a specific network partition. This provides great flexibility as network
                            partition are dynamically bind to logical partitions. Compression is performed
                            before fragmentation of the messages. To provide backward compatibility the option
                            LegacyCompression (see General options) can be set to provide compression after
                            fragmentation. The following compression values are allowed:
                            
                                - false - No compression is applied. This is also the default value if not specified.
                                - true - Compression is applicable

- Required: false

SecurityProfile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

              In the context of secure networking, the NetworkPartition element provides
              support for the attribute SecurityProfile. The attribute is referencing a security
              profile declared in the context of the Security element.
              If the given reference is invalid, the network partition configuration is invalid. In
              this case the partition will be blocked to prevent unwanted information leaks. A
              configuration error message will be logged to the ospl-error.log file. If the
              security feature has been enabled but no profile is declared, the NULL profile will be
              used by default.
              The ordering of network partition declarations in the OSPL configuration file must
              be the same for all nodes within the OpenSplice domain. If certain nodes shall not
              use one of the network partitions, the network partition in question must be declared
              as connected="false". In this case the declared security profile would not be
              evaluated or initialized, and the associated secret cipher keys need not to be defined
              for the OpenSplice node in question.

IgnoredPartition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

                        This element can be used to create a "Local Partition" that is only
                        available on the node on which it is specified, and therefore won't
                        generate network-load. Any DCPS partition-topic combination specified
                        in this element will not be distibuted by the Networking service.

DCPSPartitionTopic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                            The Networking service will match any DCPS messages
                            to the DCPSPartitionTopic expression and determine
                            if it matches. The PartitionExpression and
                            TopicExpression are allowed to contain a '*' wildcard,
                            meaning that anything matches. An exact match is
                            considered better than a wildcard match. If a DCPS messages
                            matches an expression it will not be send to the network.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

                        This element specifies a mapping between a network partition
                        and a partition-topic combination.

                        In order to give networking partitions a meaning in the context
                        of DCPS, mappings from DCPS partitions and topics onto networking
                        partitions should be defined. Networking allows for a set of

                            considered better than a wildcard match. For every
                            DCPS message, the best matching partition is determined
                            and the data is sent over the corresponding networking
                            partition as specified by the matching

Channels
========

                This element is used to group a set of Channels.

                The set of channels define the behaviour of the 'network' concerning
                aspects as priority, reliability and latency budget. By configuring
                a set of channels, the Networking service is able to function as a
                'scheduler' for the network bandwidth. It achieves this by using the
                application-defined DDS QoS policies of the data to select the most
                appropriate channel to send the data.

Channel
-------

                    This element specifies all properties of an individual Channel.

                    The Networking service will make sure messages with a higher
                    priority precede messages with a lower priority and it uses the
                    latency budget to assemble multiple messages into one UDP packet
                    where possible, to optimize the bandwidth usage. Of course, its
                    performance depends heavily on the compatbility of the configured
                    channels with the used DDS QoS policies of the applications.

- Required: true

reliable
^^^^^^^^

                        If this attribute is set to true, the channel sends all messages reliably.
                        If not, data is sent only once (fire-and-forget).

                        The specific channel a message is written into depends on the attached
                        quality of service. Once a message has arrived in a channel, it will be
                        transported with the quality of service attached to the channel. If the
                        reliable attribute happens to be set to true, the message will be sent
                        over the network using a reliability protocol.

default
^^^^^^^

                        This attribute indicates whether the channel is selected as the
                        default channel in case no channel offers the quality of service
                        requested by a message.

                        The networking channels should be configured corresponding
                        to the quality of service settings that are expected to be
                        requested by the applications. It might happen, however,
                        that none of the available channels meets the requested
                        quality of service for a specific message. In that case,
                        the message will be written into the default channel.

                        Note that only one channel is allowed to have this attribute
                        set to true

enabled
^^^^^^^

                        This attribute toggles a channel on or off. Toggling a
                        channel between enabled and disabled is a quick alternative
                        for commenting out the corresponding lines in the configuration
                        file.

priority
^^^^^^^^

                        This attribute sets the transport priority of the channel.
                        Messages sent to the network have a transport_priority
                        quality of service value. Selection of a networking channel
                        is based on the priority requested by the message and the
                        priority offered by the channel. The priority settings
                        of the different channels divide the priority range
                        into intervals. Within a channel, messages are sorted in
                        order of priority.

PortNr
^^^^^^

                        This element specifies the port number used by the Channel.
                        Messages for the channel are sent to the port number given.
                        Each channel needs its own unique port number. Please note
                        that 'reliable' channels use a second port, which is the
                        specified PortNr + 1.

- Default value: 53400
- Occurrences min-max: 1-1

FragmentSize
^^^^^^^^^^^^

                        The networking module will fragment large message into smaller
                        fragments with size **FragmentSize**. These fragments
                        are sent as datagrams to the UDP stack. OS-settings determine
                        the maximum datagram size.

- Full path: /NetworkService/Channels/Channel/FragmentSize
- Default value: 1300
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

Resolution
^^^^^^^^^^

                        The resolution indicates the number of milliseconds that
                        this channel sleeps between two consecutive resend or
                        packing actions. Latency budget values are truncated to a
                        multiple of "Resolution" milliseconds.

                        It is considered good practice to specify the ThrottleTreshold consistently throughout
                        the system.

- Default value: 10
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

AdminQueueSize
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

                        For reliable channels the receiving side needs to keep the sending
                        side informed about the received data and the received control messages.

                        This is done by means of an "AdminQueue". This setting determines the
                        size of this queue, and it must be greater than the maximum number of reliable
                        messages send or received during each "Resolution" milliseconds.

- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

CompressionBufferSize
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

                        When compression on messages is enabled then the CompressionBufferSize specifies the initial
                        size of the compression/decompression buffer. The compression buffer is used to store the messages
                        before they are compressed and send on the network. The decompression buffer is used to decompress
                        the received compressed messages. Note that the actual size of these buffers may be increased when
                        needed.

- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

CompressionThreshold
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

                        When compression on messages is enabled then the CompressionThreshold provides a threshold
                        to start compressing the accumulated data and sending the compressed data on the network.
                        The CompressionThreshold is used to estimate the size of the compressed messages.

Sending
^^^^^^^

                        This element describes all properties for the transmitting side
                        of the Channel.

CrcCheck
~~~~~~~~

                       In order to protect OpenSplice network packets from malicious attack the CrcCheck(cyclic redundancy check) configuration item has been added.
                       CRCs are specifically designed to protect against common types of errors on communication channels.
                       When enabled the integrity of delivered network packets from one DDS process to another is assured.
                       There is a small performance cost using this feature due to the addtional overhead of carrying out the crc calculation.

                       When the sending side is enabled the network packet will contain a valid crc field.

- Default value: false
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

QueueSize
~~~~~~~~~

                            This element specifies the number of messages the networking queue
                            can contain.
                            Messages sent to the network are written into the networking queue.
                            The networking service will read from this queue. If this
                            queue is full, the writer writing into the queue is suspended
                            and will retry until success. Note that a full networking queue is
                            a symptom of an improperly designed system.

MaxBurstSize
~~~~~~~~~~~~

                            Amount in bytes to be sent at maximum every
                            "Resolution" milliseconds. The default value is set to 1GB per resolution tick. This can be
                            considered "unlimited" as this far exceeds the capacity of modern physical networks.

- Full path: /NetworkService/Channels/Channel/Sending/MaxBurstSize

- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

ThrottleLimit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                            Throttling will enable you to further limit (below MaxBurstSize) the amount of data that is
                            sent every Resolution interval. This happens if one of the receiving nodes in the network
                            indicates that it has trouble processing all incoming data. This value is the lower boundary
                            of the range over which the throttling can adapt the limit. If this value is set to the same
                            value (or higher) as MaxBurstSize throttling is disabled.
                            The ThrottleLimit value is not allowed be smaller than the FragmentSize. If a lower value is
                            provided, then the value of FragmentSize is used as ThrottleLimit.

- Full path: /NetworkService/Channels/Channel/Sending/ThrottleLimit
- Default value: 10240
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

ThrottleThreshold
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                            This is the number of unprocessed network fragments that a node will store before it will inform
                            the other nodes in the network that it has trouble processing the incoming data. Those other nodes
                            can use this information to adjust their throttle values, effectively reducing the amount of incoming
                            data in case of a temporary overflow, and increasing again when the node is able to catch up.

                            It is considered good practice to specify the ThrottleTreshold consistently throughout
                            the system.

MaxRetries
~~~~~~~~~~

                            The number of retransmissions the service has to execute before considering the addressed node
                            as not responding.

- Full path: /NetworkService/Channels/Channel/Sending/MaxRetries
- Format: integer
- Default value: 100
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

RecoveryFactor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A lost message is resent after Resolution * RecoveryFactor milliseconds.

- Full path: /NetworkService/Channels/Channel/Sending/RecoveryFactor
- Format: integer
- Default value: 3
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

DiffServField
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                        This element describes the DiffServ setting the channel will apply to the networking messages.
                        This parameter determines the value of the  diffserv field of the IP version 4 packets send
                        on this channel which allows QoS setting to be applied to the network traffic send on this channel.
                        


                        Windows platform support for setting the diffserv field is dependent on the OS version.
                        For Windows versions XP SP2 and 2003 to use the diffserv field the following parameter should
                        be added to the register:
                        


                        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\TcpIp\\Parameters\\DisableUserTOSSetting
                        


                        The type of this parameter is a DWORD and it's value should be set to 0 to allow setting of the diffserv field.
                        


                        For Windows version 7 or higher a new API (qWAVE) has been introduced For these platforms the specified
                        diffserv value is mapped to one of the support traffic types. The mapping is as follows:
                        1-8 background traffic; 9-40 excellent traffic; 41-55 audio/video traffic; 56 voice traffic; 57-63 control traffic.
                        When OpenSplice is run without Administrative priveleges then only the diffserv value of 0, 8, 40 or 56 is allowed.

PacketRetentionPeriod
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

              This element specifies the number of milliseconds received packets are retained by the network
              service for its so-called "reliability-under-publisher-crash" extended reliability
              protocol. This protocol ensures that a consistent or aligned data-set is received by all
              alive (receiving) nodes, even though some nodes might not have received some
              packets at the moment a sending node disappears (for whatever reason). The
              protocol implies that each node retains sufficient received data so that it can be
              (re-)distributed if a publishing node disappears before all receiving nodes are
              "up-to-date". When the PacketRetentionPeriod element is set to 0 (the default
              value), the alignment amongst receiving nodes will not occur. To activate the
              extended realibility protocol, this setting must be configured to a time period that
              exceeds the worst-case death-detection time as configured for the discovery
              protocol of the set of distributed networking services in the system.

ReliabilityRecoveryPeriod
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

              This element specifies a timeout period (in milliseconds) for the alignment phase of the extended
              reliability protocol. It only has an effect when the related
              PacketRetentionperiod is set to a non-zero value. After the specified
              reliabilityRecoveryPeriod timeout, any data retained for the purpose of
              alignment of receiving nodes (following the disappearance or crash of a publishing
              node) will be discarded. The value of this timeout period must be sufficient to allow
              for the worst-case alignment-time of any "missed" data by individual receiving
              nodes following the disappearance of a sending node in the system.

AllowedPorts
^^^^^^^^^^^^

                AllowedPorts specifies the port numbers available for the network service to be used by the
                reliable network channels. The network channel is configured with a unique port number. However
                the reliable network channels require a second port number to provide the reliable communication
                service. For this second port number each reliable network channel will select a free port from
                the AllowedPorts.
                When the AllowedPorts is not specified for a particular channel then the default AllowedPorts which
                is configured on the Channels element is used. When also the default AllowedPorts is not specified
                each reliable network channel will first try to use the configured portNr + 1 as the second port or
                when this port number is already in use will determine a port number dynamically.
                The AllowedPorts is a list of entries where an entry is a port number or a port number range.
                When the AllowedPorts contains more than one entry then these entries must be seperated by a
                comma (,). A port number range consists of the lower and the upper bound of the port number range,
                where the lower and the upper bound are seperated by a minus (-).

Discovery
=========

                This element is used to configure the various parameters of the Discovery Channel,
                which is used to discover all relevant participating entities in the current Domain.
                The purpose of the discovery process is to build-up and maintain a notion of all
                relevant active nodes within the domain.  The relevance of discovered remote nodes
                can be defined statically (by definition of the so-called Global Partition) and/or
                can be dynamically expanded and maintained by the dynamic-discovery process driven
                by the node's Role and Scope.

- Child elements: PortNr, ProbeList
- Optional attributes: enabled, Scope

enabled
-------

                    This element can be used to enable or disable the Discovery Channel. In case the Discovery
                    Channel is disabled, entities will only detect each others presence implicitly once messages
                    are received for the first time.

Scope
-----

                    This attribute controls the dynamic discovery behaviour of this node within the current Domain.
                    If it is not set, dynamic discovery will be disabled and the networking service will only
                    communicate with nodes that can be reached through the predefined Global Partition. If the Scope
                    attribute is specified, dynamic discovery is enabled and the networking service will be able to
                    communicate with all nodes in the system that have a Role that matches the Scope expression.
                    The Scope expression can contain a comma separated list of wild-card role-expressions. If the
                    role of any  discovered node matches any of the wild-card expressions, the remote node is
                    considered a match and will become part of the communication reach (i.e. the Global Partition)
                    of the current domain.

                    ProbeList addresses can be entered by separating them by a colon (,), semicolon (;) or space( ) .
                    The addresses can be entered as dotted decimal notation or as the symbolic hostname, in which
                    case the middleware will try to resolve the corresponding IP address.

                    This element describes all properties for the transmitting side
                    of the Discovery Channel.

- Full path: /NetworkService/Discovery/Sending
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1
- Child elements: CrcCheck, DiffServField, DontRoute, TimeToLive, Interval, SafetyFactor, SalvoSize

CrcCheck
^^^^^^^^

                       In order to protect OpenSplice network packets from malicious attack the CrcCheck(cyclic redundancy check) configuration item has been added.
                       CRCs are specifically designed to protect against common types of errors on communication channels.
                       When enabled the integrity of delivered network packets from one DDS process to another is assured.
                       There is a small performance cost using this feature due to the addtional overhead of carrying out the crc calculation.

                       When the sending side is enabled the network packet will contain a valid crc field.

- Full path: /NetworkService/Discovery/Sending/CrcCheck
- Format: boolean
- Default value: false
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

DiffServField
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

                        This element describes the DiffServ setting the channel will apply to the networking messages.
                        This parameter determines the value of the  diffserv field of the IP version 4 packets send
                        on this channel which allows QoS setting to be applied to the network traffic send on this channel.
                        


                        Windows platform support for setting the diffserv field is dependent on the OS version.
                        For Windows versions XP SP2 and 2003 to use the diffserv field the following parameter should
                        be added to the register:
                        


                        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\TcpIp\\Parameters\\DisableUserTOSSetting
                        


                        The type of this parameter is a DWORD and it's value should be set to 0 to allow setting of the diffserv field.
                        


                        For Windows version 7 or higher a new API (qWAVE) has been introduced For these platforms the specified
                        diffserv value is mapped to one of the support traffic types. The mapping is as follows:
                        1-8 background traffic; 9-40 excellent traffic; 41-55 audio/video traffic; 56 voice traffic; 57-63 control traffic.
                        When OpenSplice is run without Administrative priveleges then only the diffserv value of 0, 8, 40 or 56 is allowed.

Compression
===========

                      This group of attributes specifies a compression method to
                      use within the service in partitions where it is enabled. The
                      networking service includes (depending on platform) implementations
                      of zlib, lzf and snappy. Others may be implemented by writing a
                      dynamically-loadable library and configuring it here. See the
                      OpenSplice release notes for details of how to write such a
                      library.

                      It is imperative that all nodes exchanging compressed data
                      have the same configuration in this section.

- Full path: /NetworkService/Compression
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1
- Optional attributes: PluginLibrary, PluginInitFunction, PluginParameter

PluginLibrary
-------------

                        This attribute names a dynamically loadable library
                        which must contain the code for compressing and decompressing
                        the network data. This may be left blank for the built-in
                        compressors.

- Full path: /NetworkService/Compression/PluginLibrary
- Format: string
- Default value: ""
- Required: false

PluginInitFunction
------------------

                        This attribute specifies an initialization function for a
                        compression plugin to be used within the service. The functions
                        for the built-in compressors are named ospl_comp_zlib_init,
                        ospl_comp_lzf_init and ospl_comp_snappy_init but for convenience
                        they may be specified here as as zlib, lzf or snappy.

- Full path: /NetworkService/Compression/PluginInitFunction
- Format: string
- Default value: ""
- Required: false

PluginParameter
---------------

                        Some compression implementations are configurable with
                        respect to the tradeoff between speed and effectiveness. A
                        parameter may be specified here to control this. For example
                        the zlib compressor is configured with an integer between 0
                        (for no compression) to 9 (for maximum compression).

Tracing
=======

The Tracing element controls the amount and type of information that is written into the tracing log by the DDSI service. This is useful to track the DDSI service during application development.

- Full path: /NetworkingBridgeService/Tracing
- Occurrences min-max: 0-*
- Child elements: AppendToFile, EnableCategory, OutputFile, Verbosity

AppendToFile
------------

This option specifies whether the output is to be appended to an existing log file. The default is to create a new log file each time, which is generally the best option if a detailed log is generated.

- Full path: /NetworkingBridgeService/Tracing/AppendToFile
- Format: boolean
- Default value: false
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

EnableCategory
--------------

This element enables individual logging categories. These are enabled in addition to those enabled by Tracing/Verbosity. Recognised categories are:
- *fatal*: all fatal errors, errors causing immediate termination
- *error*: failures probably impacting correctness but not necessarily causing immediate termination
- *warning*: abnormal situations that will likely not impact correctness
- *config*: full dump of the configuration
- *info*: general informational notices

In addition, there is the keyword *trace* that enables all but *radmin*

- Full path: /NetworkingBridgeService/Tracing/EnableCategory
- Format: string
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

OutputFile
----------

This option specifies where the logging is printed to. Note that *stdout* and *stderr* are treated as special values, representing "standard out" and "standard error" respectively. No file is created unless logging categories are enabled using the Tracing/Verbosity or Tracing/EnabledCategory settings.

- Full path: /NetworkingBridgeService/Tracing/OutputFile
- Format: string
- Default value: nwbridge.log
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

Verbosity

- *warning*: *severe* + warning
- *info*: *warning* + general information messages
- *config*: *info* + config
- *fine*: equivalent to *config*
- *finest*: *fine* + trace

While *none* prevents any message from being written to a NetworkingBridge log file, warnings and errors are still logged in the ospl-info.log and ospl-error.log files.

- Full path: /NetworkingBridgeService/Tracing/Verbosity
- Format: enumeration
- Default value: none
- Valid values: finest, fine, config, info, warning, severe, none
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

Watchdog

This element specifies the type of OS scheduling class will be used by the thread that announces its liveliness periodically.

- Full path: /NetworkingBridgeService/Watchdog
- Occurrences min-max: 0-*

Scheduling
----------

This element specifies the type of OS scheduling class will be used by the thread that announces its liveliness periodically.

- Full path: /NetworkingBridgeService/Watchdog/Scheduling
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1
- Child elements: Class, Priority

Class
^^^^^

This element specifies the thread scheduling class that will be used by the watchdog thread. The user may need the appropriate privileges from the underlying operating system to be able to assign some of the privileged scheduling classes.

- Full path: /NetworkingBridgeService/Watchdog/Scheduling/Class
- Format: enumeration
- Default value: default
- Valid values: realtime, timeshare, default
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

Priority
^^^^^^^^

This element specifies the thread priority. Only priorities that are supported by the underlying operating system can be assigned to this element. The user may need special privileges from the underlying operating system to be able to assign some of the privileged priorities.

- Full path: /NetworkingBridgeService/Watchdog/Scheduling/Priority
- Format: integer
- Default value: 0
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1
- Optional attributes: priority_kind

priority_kind
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This attribute specifies whether the specified Priority is a relative or absolute priority.

- Full path: /NetworkingBridgeService/Watchdog/Scheduling/Priority/priority_kind
- Format: enumeration
- Default value: relative
- Valid values: relative, absolute
- Required: false

DDSI2Service
************

The root element of a DDSI2 networking service configuration.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service
- Occurrences min-max: 0-*
- Required attributes: name

name
====

This attribute identifies the configuration for the DDSI2 Service. Multiple DDSI2 service configurations can be specified in one single resource. The actual applicable configuration is determined by the value of the name attribute, which must match the specified under the element OpenSplice/Domain/Service[@name] in the Domain Service configuration.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/name
- Format: string
- Default value: ddsi2
- Required: true

Compatibility
=============

The Compatibility elements allows specifying various settings related to compatability with standards and with other DDSI implementations.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/Compatibility
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1
- Child elements: AckNackNumbitsEmptySet, ArrivalOfDataAssertsPpAndEpLiveliness, AssumeRtiHasPmdEndpoints, ExplicitlyPublishQosSetToDefault, ManySocketsMode, RespondToRtiInitZeroAckWithInvalidHeartbeat, StandardsConformance

AckNackNumbitsEmptySet
----------------------

This element governs the representation of an acknowledgement message that does not also negatively-acknowledge some samples. If set to 0, the generated acknowledgements have an invalid form and will be reject by the strict and pedantic conformance modes, but several other implementation require this setting for smooth interoperation.

If set to 1, all acknowledgements sent by DDSI2 adhere the form of acknowledgement messages allowed by the standard, but this causes problems when interoperating with these other implementations. The strict and pedantic standards conformance modes always overrule a AckNackNumbitsEmptySet=0 to prevent the transmitting of invalid messages.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/Compatibility/AckNackNumbitsEmptySet
- Format: integer
- Default value: 0
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

ArrivalOfDataAssertsPpAndEpLiveliness
-------------------------------------

This setting is currently ignored (accepted for backwards compatibility).

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/Compatibility/ArrivalOfDataAssertsPpAndEpLiveliness
- Format: boolean
- Default value: true
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

AssumeRtiHasPmdEndpoints
------------------------

This option assumes ParticipantMessageData endpoints required by the liveliness protocol are present in RTI participants even when not properly advertised by the participant discovery protocol.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/Compatibility/AssumeRtiHasPmdEndpoints
- Format: boolean
- Default value: false
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

ExplicitlyPublishQosSetToDefault
--------------------------------

This element specifies whether QoS settings set to default values are explicitly published in the discovery protocol. Implementations are to use the default value for QoS settings not published, which allows a significant reduction of the amount of data that needs to be exchanged for the discovery protocol, but this requires all implementations to adhere to the default values specified by the specifications.

When interoperability is required with an implementation that does not follow the specifications in this regard, setting this option to true will help.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/Compatibility/ExplicitlyPublishQosSetToDefault
- Format: boolean
- Default value: false
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

ManySocketsMode
---------------

This option specifies whether a network socket will be created for each domain participant on a host. The specification seems to assume that each participant has a unique address, and setting this option will ensure this to be the case. This is not the default.

Disabling it slightly improves performance and reduces network traffic somewhat. It also causes the set of port numbers needed by DDSI2 to become predictable, which may be useful for firewall and NAT configuration.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/Compatibility/ManySocketsMode
- Format: boolean
- Default value: false
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

RespondToRtiInitZeroAckWithInvalidHeartbeat
-------------------------------------------

This element allows a closer mimicking of the behaviour of some other DDSI implementations, albeit at the cost of generating even more invalid messages. Setting it to true ensures a Heartbeat can be sent at any time when a remote node requests one, setting it to false delays it until a valid one can be sent.

The latter is fully compliant with the specification, and no adverse effects have been observed. It is the default.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/Compatibility/RespondToRtiInitZeroAckWithInvalidHeartbeat
- Format: boolean
- Default value: false
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

StandardsConformance
--------------------

This element sets the level of standards conformance of this instance of the DDSI2 Service. Stricter conformance typically means less interoperability with other implementations. Currently three modes are defined:

- *pedantic*: very strictly conform to the specification, ultimately for compliancy testing, but currently of little value because it adheres even to what will most likely turn out to be editing errors in the DDSI standard. Arguably, as long as no errata have been published it is the current text that is in effect, and that is what pedantic currently does.
- *strict*: a slightly less strict view of the standard than does pedantic: it follows the established behaviour where the standard is obviously in error.
- *lax*: attempt to provide the smoothest possible interoperability, anticipating future revisions of elements in the standard in areas that other implementations do not adhere to, even though there is no good reason not to.

The default setting is "lax".

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/Compatibility/StandardsConformance
- Format: enumeration
- Default value: lax
- Valid values: lax, strict, pedantic
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

Discovery
=========

The Discovery element allows specifying various parameters related to the discovery of peers.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/Discovery
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1
- Child elements: DSClusterLeaseDuration, DomainId, GenerateBuiltinTopics, LocalDiscoveryPartition, MaxAutoParticipantIndex, ParticipantIndex, SPDPInterval, SPDPMulticastAddress

DSClusterLeaseDuration
----------------------

This element specifies the lease duration for entities discovered through a discovery service.

Valid values are finite durations with an explicit unit or the keyword 'inf' for infinity. Recognised units: ns, us, ms, s, min, hr, day.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/Discovery/DSClusterLeaseDuration
- Format: string
- Default value: 300 s
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

DomainId
--------

This element allows overriding of the DDS Domain Id that is used for this DDSI2 service.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/Discovery/DomainId
- Format: string
- Default value: default
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

GenerateBuiltinTopics
---------------------

This element controls whether or not the DDSI2 service generates built-in topics from its discovery. When disabled, it relies on the durability service.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/Discovery/GenerateBuiltinTopics
- Format: boolean
- Default value: true
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

LocalDiscoveryPartition
-----------------------

This element controls which partition is monitored by DDSI2 for built-in topics describing entities the it mirrors in DDSI.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/Discovery/LocalDiscoveryPartition
- Format: string
- Default value: __BUILT_IN_PARTITION__
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

MaxAutoParticipantIndex
-----------------------

This element specifies the maximum DDSI participant index selected by this instance of the DDSI service if the Discovery/ParticipantIndex is "auto".

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/Discovery/MaxAutoParticipantIndex
- Format: integer
- Default value: 9
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

ParticipantIndex
----------------

This element specifies the DDSI participant index used by this instance of the DDSI service for discovery purposes. Only one such participant id is used, independent of the number of actual DomainParticipants on the node. It is either:

- *auto*: which will attempt to automatically determine an available participant index (see also Discovery/MaxAutoParticipantIndex), or
- a non-negative integer less than 120, or
- *none*:, which causes it to use arbitrary port numbers for unicast sockets which entirely removes the constraints on the participant index but makes unicast discovery impossible.

The default is *auto*. The participant index is part of the port number calculation and if predictable port numbers are needed and fixing the participant index has no adverse effects, it is recommended that the second be option be used.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/Discovery/ParticipantIndex
- Format: string
- Default value: auto
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

General
=======

The General element specifies overall DDSI2 service settings.

- Child elements: AllowMulticast, CoexistWithNativeNetworking, DontRoute, EnableMulticastLoopback, ExternalNetworkAddress, ExternalNetworkMask, MulticastRecvNetworkInterfaceAddresses, MulticastTimeToLive, NetworkInterfaceAddress, StartupModeCoversTransient, StartupModeDuration, UseIPv6

AllowMulticast
--------------

This element controls whether the DDSI2 service uses multicasts for data traffic.

When set to "false", DDSI2 will never advertise multicast addresses and never accept multicast addresses advertised by remote nodes, but it will still listen for multicast packets and perform multicast-based participant discovery. Listening for multicasts can be controlled by General/MulticastRecvNetworkInterfaceAddresses, and transmitting participant discovery multicasts by Internal/SuppressSPDPMulticast.

The default, "true", enables full use of multicasts.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/General/AllowMulticast
- Format: boolean
- Default value: true
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

CoexistWithNativeNetworking
---------------------------

This element specifies whether the DDSI2 service operates in conjunction with the OpenSplice RT Networking service. When "false", the DDSI2 service will take care of all communications, including those between OpenSplice nodes; when "true", the DDSI2 service only communicates with DDS implementations other than OpenSplice. In this case the RT Networking service should be configured as well.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/General/CoexistWithNativeNetworking
- Format: boolean
- Default value: false
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

DontRoute
---------

This element allows setting the SO_DONTROUTE option for outgoing packets, to bypass the local routing tables. This is generally useful only when the routing tables cannot be trusted, which is highly unusual.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/General/DontRoute
- Format: boolean
- Default value: false
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

EnableMulticastLoopback
-----------------------

This element specifies whether the DDSI2 service will allow IP multicast packets to be visible to all DDSI participants in the same node, including itself. It must be "true" for intra-node multicast communications, but if a node runs only a single DDSI2 service and does not host any other DDSI-capable programs, it may be set to "false" for improved performance.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/General/EnableMulticastLoopback
- Format: boolean
- Default value: true
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

ExternalNetworkAddress
----------------------

This element allows explicitly overruling the network address the DDSI2 service advertises in the discovery protocol, which by default is the address of the preferred network interface (General/NetworkInterfaceAddress), to allow DDSI2 to communicate across a Network Address Translation (NAT) device.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/General/ExternalNetworkAddress
- Format: string
- Default value: auto
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

ExternalNetworkMask
-------------------

This element specifies the network mask of the external network address. This element is relevant only when an external network address (General/ExternalNetworkAddress) is explicitly configured. In this case locators received via the discovery protocol that are within the same external subnet (as defined by this mask) will be translated to an internal address by replacing the network portion of the external address with the corresponding portion of the preferred network interface address. This option is IPv4-only.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/General/ExternalNetworkMask
- Format: string
- Default value: 0.0.0.0
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

MulticastRecvNetworkInterfaceAddresses
--------------------------------------

This element specifies on which network interfaces DDSI2 listens to multicasts. The following options are available:

- *preferred*: listen for multicasts on the preferred interface (General/NetworkInterfaceAddress); or
- *all*: listen for multicasts on all multicast-capable interfaces; or
- *any*: listen for multicasts on the operating system default interface; or
- *none*: does not listen for multicasts on any interface; or
- a comma-separated list of network addresses: configures DDSI2 to listen for multicasts on all of the listed addresses.

If DDSI2 is in IPv6 mode and the address of the preferred network interface is a link-local address, "all" is treated as a synonym for "preferred" and a comma-separated list is treated as "preferred" if it contains the preferred interface and as "none" if not.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/General/MulticastRecvNetworkInterfaceAddresses
- Format: string
- Default value: preferred
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

MulticastTimeToLive
-------------------

This element specifies the time-to-live setting for outgoing multicast packets.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/General/MulticastTimeToLive
- Format: integer
- Default value: 32
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

NetworkInterfaceAddress
-----------------------

This element specifies the preferred network interface for use by DDSI2. The preferred network interface determines the IP address that DDSI2 advertises in the discovery protocol (but see also General/ExternalNetworkAddress), and is also the only interface over which multicasts are transmitted. The interface can be identified by its IP address, network interface name or network portion of the address. If the value "auto" is entered here, DDSI2 will select what it considers the most suitable interface.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/General/NetworkInterfaceAddress
- Format: string
- Default value: auto
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

StartupModeCoversTransient
--------------------------

This element configures whether startup-mode should also cover transient and persistent data, for configurations where the durability servie does not take care of it. Configurations without defined merge policies best leave this enabled.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/General/StartupModeCoversTransient
- Format: boolean
- Default value: true
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

StartupModeDuration
-------------------

This element specifies how long the DDSI2 remains in its "startup" mode. While in "startup" mode all volatile reliable data published on the local node is retained as-if it were transient-local data, allowing existing readers on remote nodes to obtain the data even though discovering them takes some time. Best-effort data by definition need not arrive, and transient and persistent data are covered by the durability service.

Once the system is stable, the DDSI2 service keeps track of the existence of remote readers whether or not matching writers exist locally, avoiding this discovery delay and ensuring this is merely a node startup issue.

Setting General/StartupModeDuration to 0s will disable it.

The unit must be specified explicitly. Recognised units: ns, us, ms, s, min, hr, day.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/General/StartupModeDuration
- Format: string
- Default value: 2 s
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

UseIPv6
-------

This element can be used to make DDSI2 service use IPv6 instead of IPv4. This is currently an either/or switch.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/General/UseIPv6
- Format: boolean
- Default value: false
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

Internal
========

The Internal elements deal with a variety of settings that evolving and that are not necessarily fully supported. For the vast majority of the Internal settings, the functionality per-se is supported, but the right to change the way the options control the functionality is reserved. This includes renaming or moving options.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/Internal
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1
- Child elements: AccelerateRexmitBlockSize, AggressiveKeepLast1Whc, AssumeMulticastCapable, BuiltinEndpointSet, ConservativeBuiltinReaderStartup, DDSI2DirectMaxThreads, DefragReliableMaxSamples, DefragUnreliableMaxSamples, DeliveryQueueMaxSamples, ForwardAllMessages, ForwardRemoteData, FragmentSize, GenerateKeyhash, LateAckMode, LeaseDuration, LegacyFragmentation, LogStackTraces, MaxMessageSize, MaxParticipants, MaxQueuedRexmitBytes, MaxQueuedRexmitMessages, MaxSampleSize, MeasureHbToAckLatency, MinimumSocketReceiveBufferSize, MinimumSocketSendBufferSize, MirrorRemoteEntities, NackDelay, PreEmptiveAckDelay, PrimaryReorderMaxSamples, ResponsivenessTimeout, RetransmitMerging, RetransmitMergingPeriod, RetryOnRejectBestEffort, RetryOnRejectDuration, SPDPResponseMaxDelay, ScheduleTimeRounding, SecondaryReorderMaxSamples, SquashParticipants, SuppressSPDPMulticast, SynchronousDeliveryLatencyBound, SynchronousDeliveryPriorityThreshold, UnicastResponseToSPDPMessages, WriterLingerDuration

AccelerateRexmitBlockSize
-------------------------

**Internal** Proxy readers that are assumed to sill be retrieving historical data get this many samples retransmitted when they NACK something, even if some of these samples have sequence numbers outside the set covered by the NACK.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/Internal/AccelerateRexmitBlockSize
- Format: integer
- Default value: 0
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

AggressiveKeepLast1Whc
----------------------

**Internal** This element controls whether to drop a reliable sample from a DDSI2 WHC before all readers have acknowledged it as soon as a later sample becomes available. It only affects DCPS data writers with a history QoS setting of KEEP_LAST with depth 1. The default setting, *false*, mimics the behaviour of the OpenSplice RT networking and is necessary to make the behaviour of wait_for_acknowledgements() consistent across the networking services.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/Internal/AggressiveKeepLast1Whc
- Format: boolean
- Default value: false
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

AssumeMulticastCapable
----------------------

**Internal** This element controls which network interfaces are assumed to be capable of multicasting even when the interface flags returned by the operating system state it is not (this provides a workaround for some platforms). It is a comma-separated lists of patterns (with ? and * wildcards) against which the interface names are matched.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/Internal/AssumeMulticastCapable
- Format: string
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

BuiltinEndpointSet
------------------

**Internal** This element controls which participants will have which built-in endpoints for the discovery and liveliness protocols. Valid values are:

- *full*: all participants have all endpoints;
- *writers*: all participants have the writers, but just one has the readers;
- *minimal*: only one participant has built-in endpoints.

The default is *writers*, as this is thought to be compliant and reasonably efficient. *Minimal* may or may not be compliant but is most efficient, and *full* is inefficient but certain to be compliant. See also Internal/ConservativeBuiltinReaderStartup.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/Internal/BuiltinEndpointSet
- Format: enumeration
- Default value: writers
- Valid values: full, writers, minimal
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

ConservativeBuiltinReaderStartup
--------------------------------

**Internal** This element forces all DDSI2 built-in discovery-related readers to request all historical data, instead of just one for each "topic". There is no indication that any of the current DDSI implementations requires changing of this setting, but it is conceivable that an implementation might track which participants have been informed of the existence of endpoints and which have not been, refusing communication with those that have "can't" know.

Should it be necessary to hide DDSI2's shared discovery behaviour, set this to *true* and Internal/BuiltinEndpointSet to *full*.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/Internal/ConservativeBuiltinReaderStartup
- Format: boolean
- Default value: false
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

DDSI2DirectMaxThreads
---------------------

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/Internal/DDSI2DirectMaxThreads
- Format: integer
- Default value: 1

**Internal** This element controls the Maximum size of a delivery queue, expressed in samples. Once a delivery queue is full, incoming samples destined for that queue are dropped until space becomes available again.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/Internal/DeliveryQueueMaxSamples
- Format: integer
- Default value: 256
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

ForwardAllMessages
------------------

**Internal** Forward all messages from a writer, rather than trying to forward each sample only once. The default of trying to forward each sample only once filters out duplicates for writers in multiple partitions under nearly all circumstances, but may still publish the odd duplicate. Note: the current implementation also can lose in contrived test cases, that publish more than 2**32 samples using a single data writer in conjunction with carefully controlled management of the writer history via cooperating local readers.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/Internal/ForwardAllMessages
- Format: boolean
- Default value: false
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

- Format: enumeration
- Default value: default
- Valid values: false, default, true
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

FragmentSize
------------

**Internal** This element specifies the size of DDSI sample fragments generated by DDSI2. Samples larger than FragmentSize are fragmented into fragments of FragmentSize bytes each, except the last one, which may be smaller. The DDSI spec mandates a minimum fragment size of 1025 bytes, but DDSI2 will do whatever size is requested, accepting fragments of which the size is at least the minimum of 1025 and FragmentSize.

The unit must be specified explicitly. Recognised units: B (bytes), kB & KiB (2 :sup:`10` bytes), MB & MiB (2 :sup:`20` bytes), GB & GiB (2 :sup:`30` bytes).

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/Internal/FragmentSize

- Format: boolean
- Default value: false
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

The unit must be specified explicitly. Recognised units: ns, us, ms, s, min, hr, day.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/Internal/LeaseDuration
- Format: string

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/Internal/LegacyFragmentation
- Format: boolean
- Default value: false
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

LogStackTraces
--------------

This element controls whether or not to write stack traces to the DDSI2 trace when a thread fails to make progress (on select platforms only).

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/Internal/LogStackTraces
- Format: boolean
- Default value: false
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

MaxMessageSize
--------------

**Internal** This element specifies the maximum size of the UDP payload that DDSI2 will generate. DDSI2 will try to maintain this limit within the bounds of the DDSI specification, which means that in some cases (especially for very low values of MaxMessageSize) larger payloads may sporadically be observed (currently up to 1192 B).

On some networks it may be necessary to set this item to keep the packetsize below the MTU to prevent IP fragmentation. In those cases, it is generally advisable to also consider reducing Internal/FragmentSize.

The unit must be specified explicitly. Recognised units: B (bytes), kB & KiB (2 :sup:`10` bytes), MB & MiB (2 :sup:`20` bytes), GB & GiB (2 :sup:`30` bytes).

MaxQueuedRexmitBytes
--------------------

**Internal** This setting limits the maximum number of bytes queued for retransmission. The default value of 0 is unlimited unless an AuxiliaryBandwidthLimit has been set, in which case it becomes NackDelay * AuxiliaryBandwidthLimit.

- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

MeasureHbToAckLatency
---------------------

- Format: boolean
- Default value: false
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

MinimumSocketReceiveBufferSize
------------------------------

**Internal** This setting controls the minimum size of socket receive buffers. This setting can only increase the size of the receive buffer, if the operating system by default creates a larger buffer, it is left unchanged.

The unit must be specified explicitly. Recognised units: B (bytes), kB & KiB (2 :sup:`10` bytes), MB & MiB (2 :sup:`20` bytes), GB & GiB (2 :sup:`30` bytes).

- Format: string
- Default value: default
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

MinimumSocketSendBufferSize
---------------------------

**Internal** This setting controls the minimum size of socket send buffers. This setting can only increase the size of the send buffer, if the operating system by default creates a larger buffer, it is left unchanged.

The unit must be specified explicitly. Recognised units: B (bytes), kB & KiB (2 :sup:`10` bytes), MB & MiB (2 :sup:`20` bytes), GB & GiB (2 :sup:`30` bytes).

- Valid values: false, default, true
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

NackDelay
---------

**Internal** This setting controls the delay between receipt of a HEARTBEAT indicating missing samples and a NACK (ignored when the HEARTBEAT requires an answer). However, no NACK is sent if a NACK had been scheduled already for a response earlier than the delay requests: then that NACK will incorporate the latest information.

The unit must be specified explicitly. Recognised units: ns, us, ms, s, min, hr, day.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/Internal/PrimaryReorderMaxSamples
- Format: integer
- Default value: 64
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

ResponsivenessTimeout
---------------------

**Internal** This element controls for how long an unresponsive reader can block the transmit thread by failing to acknowledge data when a writer's DDSI2 WHC is full. If after this time the writer's WHC has not shrunk to below the low-water mark, the reader is considered unresponsive and degraded to unreliable. It will be restored to reliable service once it resumes acknowledging ing samples.

The unit must be specified explicitly. Recognised units: ns, us, ms, s, min, hr, day.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/Internal/ResponsivenessTimeout
- Format: string
- Default value: 1 s

RetransmitMerging
-----------------

**Internal** This elements controls the addressing and timing of retransmits. Possible values are:

- *never*: retransmit only to the NACK-ing reader;
- *adaptive*: attempt to combine retransmits needed for reliability, but send historical (transient-local) data to the requesting reader only;
- *always*: do not distinguish between different causes, always try to merge.

The default is *adaptive*. See also Internal/RetransmitMergingPeriod.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/Internal/RetransmitMerging
- Format: enumeration
- Default value: adaptive
- Valid values: never, adaptive, always
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

RetransmitMergingPeriod
-----------------------

**Internal** This setting determines the size of the time window in which a NACK of some sample is ignored because a retransmit of that sample has been multicasted too recently. This setting has no effect of unicasted retransmits.

- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

RetryOnRejectDuration
---------------------

**Internal** How long to keep locally retrying pushing a received sample into the reader caches when resource limits are reached. Default is dependent on Internal/LateAckMode: if the latter is false, it is 80% of Internal/ResponsivenessTimeout, otherwise it is 0.

- Format: string
- Default value: 0 ms
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

ScheduleTimeRounding
--------------------

**Internal** This setting allows the timing of scheduled events to be rounded up so that more events can be handled in a single cycle of the event queue. The default is 0 and causes no rounding at all, i.e. are scheduled exactly, whereas a value of 10ms would mean that events are rounded up to the nearest 10 milliseconds.

The unit must be specified explicitly. Recognised units: ns, us, ms, s, min, hr, day.

- Format: string
- Default value: 0 ms

- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

SquashParticipants
------------------

**Internal** This element controls whether DDSI2 advertises all the domain participants it serves in DDSI (when set to *false*), or rather only one domain participant (the one corresponding to the DDSI2 process; when set to *true*). In the latter case DDSI2 becomes the virtual owner of all readers and writers of all domain participants, dramatically reducing discovery traffic.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/Internal/SquashParticipants
- Format: boolean
- Default value: false
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

SuppressSPDPMulticast
---------------------

**Internal** The element controls whether the mandatory multicasting of the participant discovery packets occurs. Completely disabling multicasting requires this element be set to *true*, and generally requires explicitly listing peers to ping for unicast discovery.

See also General/AllowMulticast.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/Internal/SuppressSPDPMulticast
- Format: boolean
- Default value: false
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

SynchronousDeliveryLatencyBound
-------------------------------

**Internal** This element controls whether samples sent by a writer with QoS settings transport_priority >= SynchronousDeliveryPriorityThreshold and a latency_budget at most this element's value will be delivered synchronously from the "recv" thread, all others will be delivered asynchronously through delivery queues.

------------------------------------

**Internal** This element controls whether samples sent by a writer with QoS settings latency_budget <= SynchronousDeliveryLatencyBound and transport_priority greater than or equal to this element's value will be delivered synchronously from the "recv" thread, all others will be delivered asynchronously through delivery queues. This reduces latency at the expense of aggregate bandwidth.

Larger values allow large bursts of writes to occur without forcing synchronization between the application and the DDSI2 service, but do introduce the potential for longer latencies and increase the maximum amount of memory potentially occupied by messages in the queue.

- Format: integer
- Default value: 1000
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

ReceiveBufferChunkSize
----------------------

Size of one allocation unit in the receive buffer. Must be greater than the maximum packet size by a modest amount (too large packets are dropped). Each allocation is shrunk immediately after processing a message, or freed straightaway.

The unit must be specified explicitly. Recognised units: B (bytes), kB & KiB (2 :sup:`10` bytes), MB & MiB (2 :sup:`20` bytes), GB & GiB (2 :sup:`30` bytes).

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/TCP/NoDelay
- Format: boolean
- Default value: true
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

Port
----

This element specifies the TCP port number on which the service accepts connections. If the port is set it is used in entity locators, published with DDSI discovery. Dynamically allocated if zero. Disabled if -1 or not configured. If disabled other DDSI services will not be able to establish connections with the service, the service can only communicate by establishing connections to other services.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/TCP/Port
- Format: integer
- Default value: -1
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

ReadTimeout

- Format: string
- Default value: 2 s
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

WriteTimeout
------------

This element specifies the timeout for blocking TCP write operations. If this timeout expires then the connection is closed.

The unit must be specified explicitly. Recognised units: ns, us, ms, s, min, hr, day.

- Occurrences min-max: 0-1
- Child elements: Class, Priority

Class
~~~~~

This element specifies the thread scheduling class (*realtime*, *timeshare* or *default*). The user may need special privileges from the underlying operating system to be able to assign some of the privileged scheduling classes.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/Threads/Thread/Scheduling/Class
- Format: enumeration
- Default value: default
- Valid values: realtime, timeshare, default
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

~~~~~~~~

This element specifies the thread priority (decimal integer or *default*). Only priorities that are supported by the underlying operating system can be assigned to this element. The user may need special privileges from the underlying operating system to be able to assign some of the privileged priorities.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/Threads/Thread/Scheduling/Priority
- Format: string
- Default value: default
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

The unit must be specified explicitly. Recognised units: B (bytes), kB & KiB (2 :sup:`10` bytes), MB & MiB (2 :sup:`20` bytes), GB & GiB (2 :sup:`30` bytes).

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/Threads/Thread/StackSize
- Format: string
- Default value: default
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

Tracing
=======

The Tracing element controls the amount and type of information that is written into the tracing log by the DDSI service. This is useful to track the DDSI service during application development.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/Tracing
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1
- Child elements: AppendToFile, EnableCategory, OutputFile, PacketCaptureFile, Timestamps, Verbosity

AppendToFile
------------

This option specifies whether the output is to be appended to an existing log file. The default is to create a new log file each time, which is generally the best option if a detailed log is generated.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/Tracing/AppendToFile
- Format: boolean
- Default value: false
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

EnableCategory
--------------

This element enables individual logging categories. These are enabled in addition to those enabled by Tracing/Verbosity. Recognised categories are:

- *fatal*: all fatal errors, errors causing immediate termination
- *error*: failures probably impacting correctness but not necessarily causing immediate termination
- *warning*: abnormal situations that will likely not impact correctness
- *config*: full dump of the configuration
- *info*: general informational notices
- *discovery*: all discovery activity
- *data*: include data content of samples in traces
- *radmin*: receive buffer administration
- *timing*: periodic reporting of CPU loads per thread
- *traffic*: periodic reporting of total outgoing data

In addition, there is the keyword *trace* that enables all but *radmin*
.
The categorisation of tracing output is incomplete and hence most of the verbosity levels and categories are not of much use in the current release. This is an ongoing process and here we describe the target situation rather than the current situation. Currently, the most useful is *trace*.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/Tracing/EnableCategory
- Format: string
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

OutputFile
----------

This option specifies where the logging is printed to. Note that *stdout* and *stderr* are treated as special values, representing "standard out" and "standard error" respectively. No file is created unless logging categories are enabled using the Tracing/Verbosity or Tracing/EnabledCategory settings.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/Tracing/OutputFile
- Format: string
- Default value: ddsi2.log
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

PacketCaptureFile
-----------------

This option specifies the file to which received and sent packets will be logged in the "pcap" format suitable for analysis using common networking tools, such as WireShark. IP and UDP headers are ficitious, in particular the destination address of received packets. The TTL may be used to distinguish between sent and received packets: it is 255 for sent packets and 128 for received ones. Currently IPv4 only.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/Tracing/PacketCaptureFile
- Format: string
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

Timestamps
----------

This option has no effect.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/Tracing/Timestamps
- Format: boolean
- Default value: true
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1
- Optional attributes: absolute

absolute
^^^^^^^^

This attribute specifies whether the timestamps in the log file are absolute or relative to the startup time of the service.  Currently not implemented in DDSI2, all timestamps are absolute.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/Tracing/Timestamps/absolute
- Format: boolean
- Default value: true
- Required: false

Verbosity
---------

This element enables standard groups of categories, based on a desired verbosity level. This is in addition to the categories enabled by the Tracing/EnableCategory setting. Recognised verbosity levels and the categories they map to are:

- *none*: no DDSI2 log
- *severe*: error and fatal
- *warning*: *severe* + warning
- *info*: equivalent to *warning*
- *config*: *info* + config
- *fine*: *config* + discovery
- *finer*: *fine* + traffic, timing & info
- *finest*: *finer* + trace

While *none* prevents any message from being written to a DDSI2 log file, warnings and errors are still logged in the ospl-info.log and ospl-error.log files.

The categorisation of tracing output is incomplete and hence most of the verbosity levels and categories are not of much use in the current release. This is an ongoing process and here we describe the target situation rather than the current situation. Currently, the most useful verbosity levels are *config* and *finest*.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/Tracing/Verbosity
- Format: enumeration
- Default value: none
- Valid values: finest, finer, fine, config, info, warning, severe, none
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

Watchdog
========

This element specifies the type of OS scheduling class will be used by the thread that announces its liveliness periodically.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/Watchdog
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

Scheduling
----------

This element specifies the type of OS scheduling class will be used by the thread that announces its liveliness periodically.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/Watchdog/Scheduling
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1
- Child elements: Class, Priority

Class
^^^^^

This element specifies the thread scheduling class that will be used by the watchdog thread. The user may need the appropriate privileges from the underlying operating system to be able to assign some of the privileged scheduling classes.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/Watchdog/Scheduling/Class
- Format: enumeration
- Default value: default
- Valid values: realtime, timeshare, default
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

Priority
^^^^^^^^

This element specifies the thread priority. Only priorities that are supported by the underlying operating system can be assigned to this element. The user may need special privileges from the underlying operating system to be able to assign some of the privileged priorities.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/Watchdog/Scheduling/Priority
- Format: integer
- Default value: 0
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1
- Optional attributes: priority_kind

priority_kind
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This attribute specifies whether the specified Priority is a relative or absolute priority.

- Full path: /DDSI2Service/Watchdog/Scheduling/Priority/priority_kind
- Format: enumeration
- Default value: relative
- Valid values: relative, absolute
- Required: false

DDSI2EService
*************

The root element of a DDSI2E networking service configuration.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService
- Occurrences min-max: 0-*
- Required attributes: name

name
====

This attribute identifies the configuration for the DDSI2E Service. Multiple DDSI2E service configurations can be specified in one single resource. The actual applicable configuration is determined by the value of the name attribute, which must match the specified under the element OpenSplice/Domain/Service[@name] in the Domain Service configuration.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/name
- Format: string
- Default value: ddsi2e
- Required: true

Channels
========

This element is used to group a set of channels. The channels are independent data paths through DDSI2E and by using separate threads and setting their priorities appropriately, chanenls can be used to map transport priorities to operating system scheduler priorities, ensuring system-wide end-to-end priority preservation.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Channels
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

Channel
-------

This element defines a channel.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Channels/Channel
- Occurrences min-max: 0-42
- Child elements: AuxiliaryBandwidthLimit, DataBandwidthLimit, DiffServField, QueueSize, Resolution
- Required attributes: Name
- Optional attributes: TransportPriority

Name
^^^^

This attribute specifies name of this channel. The name should uniquely identify the channel.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Channels/Channel/Name
- Format: string
- Default value: n/a
- Required: true

TransportPriority
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This attribute sets the transport priority threshold for the channel. Each DCPS data writer has a "transport_priority" QoS and this QoS is used to select a channel for use by this writer. The selected channel is the one with the largest threshold not greater than the writer's transport priority, and if no such channel exists, the channel with the lowest threshold.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Channels/Channel/TransportPriority
- Format: integer
- Default value: 0
- Required: false

AuxiliaryBandwidthLimit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This element specifies the maximum transmit rate of auxiliary traffic on this channel (e.g. retransmits, heartbeats, etc). Bandwidth limiting uses a leaky bucket scheme. The default value "inf" means DDSI2E imposes no limitation, the underlying operating system and hardware will likely limit the maimum transmit rate.
The unit must be specified explicitly. Recognised units: *X*b/s, *X*bps for bits/s or *X*B/s, *X*Bps for bytes/s; where *X* is an optional prefix: k for 10 :sup:`3`, Ki for 2 :sup:`10`, M for 10 :sup:`6`, Mi for 2 :sup:`20`, G for 10 :sup:`9`, Gi for 2 :sup:`30`.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Channels/Channel/AuxiliaryBandwidthLimit
- Format: string
- Default value: inf
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

DataBandwidthLimit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This element specifies the maximum transmit rate of new samples and directly related data, for this channel. Bandwidth limiting uses a leaky bucket scheme. The default value "inf" means DDSI2E imposes no limitation, the underlying operating system and hardware will likely limit the maimum transmit rate.

The unit must be specified explicitly. Recognised units: *X*b/s, *X*bps for bits/s or *X*B/s, *X*Bps for bytes/s; where *X* is an optional prefix: k for 10 :sup:`3`, Ki for 2 :sup:`10`, M for 10 :sup:`6`, Mi for 2 :sup:`20`, G for 10 :sup:`9`, Gi for 2 :sup:`30`.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Channels/Channel/DataBandwidthLimit
- Format: string
- Default value: inf
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

DiffServField
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This element describes the DiffServ setting the channel will apply to the networking messages. This parameter determines the value of the diffserv field of the IP version 4 packets send on this channel which allows QoS setting to be applied to the network traffic send on this channel.

Windows platform support for setting the diffserv field is dependent on the OS version.

For Windows versions XP SP2 and 2003 to use the diffserv field the following parameter should be added to the register:


HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\TcpIp\\Parameters\\DisableUserTOSSetting


The type of this parameter is a DWORD and it's value should be set to 0 to allow setting of the diffserv field.


For Windows version 7 or higher a new API (qWAVE) has been introduced For these platforms the specified diffserv value is mapped to one of the support traffic types.
The mapping is as follows: 1-8 background traffic; 9-40 excellent traffic; 41-55 audio/video traffic; 56 voice traffic; 57-63 control traffic.
When an application is run without Administrative priveleges then only the diffserv value of 0, 8, 40 or 56 is allowed.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Channels/Channel/DiffServField
- Format: integer
- Default value: 0
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

QueueSize
^^^^^^^^^

This element specifies the number of messages the network queue for this channel can contain. The OpenSplice kernel writes data to be transmitted to the network queue, and DDSI2E takes them from this queue. If this queue is full when an application tries to write a sample, the sample will be dropped or the writer suspended, depending on the QoS settings of the writer. OpenSplice and its services are optimised for a well-balanced system design, where the queue never becomes full.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Channels/Channel/QueueSize
- Format: integer
- Default value: 0
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

Resolution
^^^^^^^^^^

This element specifies the interval at which the DDSI transmit thread for this channel wakes up, and which controls the smallest latency_budget that has an effect. A shorter latency_budget is rounded to 0. The downside of a reducing this setting is that it increases the number of idle wake-ups of the transmit thread when there is no data to be sent.

Valid values are finite durations with an explicit unit or the keyword 'inf' for infinity. Recognised units: ns, us, ms, s, min, hr, day.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Channels/Channel/Resolution
- Format: string
- Default value: 1s
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

Compatibility
=============

The Compatibility elements allows specifying various settings related to compatability with standards and with other DDSI implementations.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Compatibility
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1
- Child elements: AckNackNumbitsEmptySet, ArrivalOfDataAssertsPpAndEpLiveliness, AssumeRtiHasPmdEndpoints, ExplicitlyPublishQosSetToDefault, ManySocketsMode, RespondToRtiInitZeroAckWithInvalidHeartbeat, StandardsConformance

AckNackNumbitsEmptySet
----------------------

This element governs the representation of an acknowledgement message that does not also negatively-acknowledge some samples. If set to 0, the generated acknowledgements have an invalid form and will be reject by the strict and pedantic conformance modes, but several other implementation require this setting for smooth interoperation.

If set to 1, all acknowledgements sent by DDSI2E adhere the form of acknowledgement messages allowed by the standard, but this causes problems when interoperating with these other implementations. The strict and pedantic standards conformance modes always overrule a AckNackNumbitsEmptySet=0 to prevent the transmitting of invalid messages.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Compatibility/AckNackNumbitsEmptySet
- Format: integer
- Default value: 0
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

ArrivalOfDataAssertsPpAndEpLiveliness
-------------------------------------

This setting is currently ignored (accepted for backwards compatibility).

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Compatibility/ArrivalOfDataAssertsPpAndEpLiveliness
- Format: boolean
- Default value: true
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

AssumeRtiHasPmdEndpoints
------------------------

This option assumes ParticipantMessageData endpoints required by the liveliness protocol are present in RTI participants even when not properly advertised by the participant discovery protocol.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Compatibility/AssumeRtiHasPmdEndpoints
- Format: boolean
- Default value: false
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

ExplicitlyPublishQosSetToDefault
--------------------------------

This element specifies whether QoS settings set to default values are explicitly published in the discovery protocol. Implementations are to use the default value for QoS settings not published, which allows a significant reduction of the amount of data that needs to be exchanged for the discovery protocol, but this requires all implementations to adhere to the default values specified by the specifications.

When interoperability is required with an implementation that does not follow the specifications in this regard, setting this option to true will help.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Compatibility/ExplicitlyPublishQosSetToDefault
- Format: boolean
- Default value: false
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

ManySocketsMode
---------------

This option specifies whether a network socket will be created for each domain participant on a host. The specification seems to assume that each participant has a unique address, and setting this option will ensure this to be the case. This is not the default.

Disabling it slightly improves performance and reduces network traffic somewhat. It also causes the set of port numbers needed by DDSI2E to become predictable, which may be useful for firewall and NAT configuration.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Compatibility/ManySocketsMode
- Format: boolean
- Default value: false
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

RespondToRtiInitZeroAckWithInvalidHeartbeat
-------------------------------------------

This element allows a closer mimicking of the behaviour of some other DDSI implementations, albeit at the cost of generating even more invalid messages. Setting it to true ensures a Heartbeat can be sent at any time when a remote node requests one, setting it to false delays it until a valid one can be sent.

The latter is fully compliant with the specification, and no adverse effects have been observed. It is the default.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Compatibility/RespondToRtiInitZeroAckWithInvalidHeartbeat
- Format: boolean
- Default value: false
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

StandardsConformance
--------------------

This element sets the level of standards conformance of this instance of the DDSI2E Service. Stricter conformance typically means less interoperability with other implementations. Currently three modes are defined:

- *pedantic*: very strictly conform to the specification, ultimately for compliancy testing, but currently of little value because it adheres even to what will most likely turn out to be editing errors in the DDSI standard. Arguably, as long as no errata have been published it is the current text that is in effect, and that is what pedantic currently does.
- *strict*: a slightly less strict view of the standard than does pedantic: it follows the established behaviour where the standard is obviously in error.
- *lax*: attempt to provide the smoothest possible interoperability, anticipating future revisions of elements in the standard in areas that other implementations do not adhere to, even though there is no good reason not to.

The default setting is "lax".

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Compatibility/StandardsConformance
- Format: enumeration
- Default value: lax
- Valid values: lax, strict, pedantic
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

Discovery
=========

The Discovery element allows specifying various parameters related to the discovery of peers.

- Occurrences min-max: 0-1
- Child elements: DefaultMulticastAddress, DomainId, DSClusterLeaseDuration, GenerateBuiltinTopics, LocalDiscoveryPartition, MaxAutoParticipantIndex, ParticipantIndex, SPDPInterval, SPDPMulticastAddress

DefaultMulticastAddress
-----------------------

              This element specifies the default multicast address for all multicast traffic other than the SPDP participant discovery data. The default value "auto" uses the configured SPDPMulticastAddress. On source-specific multicast capable platforms, this is may be an source-specific multicast address.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Discovery/DefaultMulticastAddress
- Format: string
- Default value: auto
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

DomainId
--------

This element allows overriding of the DDS Domain Id that is used for this DDSI2E service.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Discovery/DomainId
- Format: string
- Default value: default
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

DSClusterLeaseDuration
----------------------

              This element specifies the lease duration for entities discovered through a discovery service.

              Valid values are finite durations with an explicit unit or the keyword 'inf' for infinity. Recognised units: ns, us, ms, s, min, hr, day.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Discovery/DSClusterLeaseDuration
- Format: string
- Default value: 300 s
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

GenerateBuiltinTopics
---------------------

This element controls whether or not the DDSI2E service generates built-in topics from its discovery. When disabled, it relies on the durability service.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Discovery/GenerateBuiltinTopics
- Format: boolean
- Default value: true
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

LocalDiscoveryPartition
-----------------------

This element controls which partition is monitored by DDSI2E for built-in topics describing entities the it mirrors in DDSI.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Discovery/LocalDiscoveryPartition
- Format: string
- Default value: __BUILT_IN_PARTITION__
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

MaxAutoParticipantIndex
-----------------------

This element specifies the maximum DDSI participant index selected by this instance of the DDSI2E service if the Discovery/ParticipantIndex is "auto".

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Discovery/MaxAutoParticipantIndex
- Format: integer
- Default value: 9
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

ParticipantIndex
----------------

This element specifies the DDSI participant index used by this instance of the DDSI2E service for discovery purposes. Only one such participant id is used, independent of the number of actual DomainParticipants on the node. It is either:

- *auto*: which will attempt to automatically determine an available participant index (see also Discovery/MaxAutoParticipantIndex), or
- a non-negative integer less than 120, or
- *none*:, which causes it to use arbitrary port numbers for unicast sockets which entirely removes the constraints on the participant index but makes unicast discovery impossible.

The default is *auto*. The participant index is part of the port number calculation and if predictable port numbers are needed and fixing the participant index has no adverse effects, it is recommended that the second be option be used.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Discovery/ParticipantIndex
- Format: string
- Default value: auto
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

Ports
-----

The Ports element allows specifying various parameters related to the port numbers used for discovery. These all have default values specified by the DDSI 2.1 specification and rarely need to be changed.

Valid values are finite durations with an explicit unit or the keyword 'inf' for infinity. Recognised units: ns, us, ms, s, min, hr, day.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Discovery/SPDPInterval
- Format: string
- Default value: 30 s
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

SPDPMulticastAddress
--------------------

This element specifies the multicast address that is used as the destination for the participant discovery packets. In IPv4 mode the default is the (standardised) 239.255.0.1, in IPv6 mode it becomes ff02::ffff:239.255.0.1, which is a non-standardised link-local multicast address.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Discovery/SPDPMulticastAddress
- Format: string
- Default value: 239.255.0.1
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

General
=======

The General element specifies overall DDSI2E service settings.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/General
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1
- Child elements: AllowMulticast, CoexistWithNativeNetworking, DontRoute, EnableMulticastLoopback, ExternalNetworkAddress, ExternalNetworkMask, MulticastRecvNetworkInterfaceAddresses, MulticastTimeToLive, NetworkInterfaceAddress, StartupModeCoversTransient, StartupModeDuration, UseIPv6

AllowMulticast
--------------

This element controls whether the DDSI2E service uses multicasts for data traffic. It is a comma-separated list of keywords, with the following keywords defined:


- *spdp*: allow multicast for the SPDP participant discovery protocol. This is the initial step in the discovery protocol, and benefits tremendously from using multicast.
- *asm*: allow (any-source) multicast for all traffic.
- *ssm*: allow source-specific multicast for all traffic (on supported platforms).


Additionally, "false" is allowed as a synonym for an empty list, and "true" for "spdp,asm,ssm".

The default is to allow unlimited use of multicast.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/General/AllowMulticast
- Format: string
- Default value: true
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

CoexistWithNativeNetworking
---------------------------

This element specifies whether the DDSI2E service operates in conjunction with the OpenSplice RT Networking service. When "false", the DDSI2E service will take care of all communications, including those between OpenSplice nodes; when "true", the DDSI2E service only communicates with DDS implementations other than OpenSplice. In this case the RT Networking service should be configured as well.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/General/CoexistWithNativeNetworking
- Format: boolean
- Default value: false
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

DontRoute
---------

This element allows setting the SO_DONTROUTE option for outgoing packets, to bypass the local routing tables. This is generally useful only when the routing tables cannot be trusted, which is highly unusual.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/General/DontRoute
- Format: boolean
- Default value: false
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

EnableMulticastLoopback
-----------------------

This element specifies whether the DDSI2E service will allow IP multicast packets to be visible to all DDSI participants in the same node, including itself. It must be "true" for intra-node multicast communications, but if a node runs only a single DDSI2E service and does not host any other DDSI-capable programs, it may be set to "false" for improved performance.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/General/EnableMulticastLoopback
- Format: boolean
- Default value: true
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

ExternalNetworkAddress
----------------------

This element allows explicitly overruling the network address the DDSI2E service advertises in the discovery protocol, which by default is the address of the preferred network interface (General/NetworkInterfaceAddress), to allow DDSI2E to communicate across a Network Address Translation (NAT) device.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/General/ExternalNetworkAddress
- Format: string
- Default value: auto
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

ExternalNetworkMask
-------------------

This element specifies the network mask of the external network address. This element is relevant only when an external network address (General/ExternalNetworkAddress) is explicitly configured. In this case locators received via the discovery protocol that are within the same external subnet (as defined by this mask) will be translated to an internal address by replacing the network portion of the external address with the corresponding portion of the preferred network interface address. This option is IPv4-only.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/General/ExternalNetworkMask
- Format: string
- Default value: 0.0.0.0
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

MulticastRecvNetworkInterfaceAddresses
--------------------------------------

This element specifies on which network interfaces DDSI2E listens to multicasts. The following options are available:

- *preferred*: listen for multicasts on the preferred interface (General/NetworkInterfaceAddress); or
- *all*: listen for multicasts on all multicast-capable interfaces; or
- *any*: listen for multicasts on the operating system default interface; or
- *none*: does not listen for multicasts on any interface; or
- a comma-separated list of network addresses: configures DDSI2E to listen for multicasts on all of the listed addresses.

If DDSI2E is in IPv6 mode and the address of the preferred network interface is a link-local address, "all" is treated as a synonym for "preferred" and a comma-separated list is treated as "preferred" if it contains the preferred interface and as "none" if not.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/General/MulticastRecvNetworkInterfaceAddresses
- Format: string
- Default value: preferred
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

MulticastTimeToLive
-------------------

This element specifies the time-to-live setting for outgoing multicast packets.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/General/MulticastTimeToLive
- Format: integer
- Default value: 32
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

NetworkInterfaceAddress
-----------------------

This element specifies the preferred network interface for use by DDSI2E. The preferred network interface determines the IP address that DDSI2E advertises in the discovery protocol (but see also General/ExternalNetworkAddress), and is also the only interface over which multicasts are transmitted. The interface can be identified by its IP address, network interface name or network portion of the address. If the value "auto" is entered here, DDSI2E will select what it considers the most suitable interface.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/General/NetworkInterfaceAddress
- Format: string
- Default value: auto
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

StartupModeCoversTransient
--------------------------

This element configures whether startup-mode should also cover transient and persistent data, for configurations where the durability servie does not take care of it. Configurations without defined merge policies best leave this enabled.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/General/StartupModeCoversTransient
- Format: boolean
- Default value: true
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

StartupModeDuration
-------------------

This element specifies how long the DDSI2E remains in its "startup" mode. While in "startup" mode all volatile reliable data published on the local node is retained as-if it were transient-local data, allowing existing readers on remote nodes to obtain the data even though discovering them takes some time. Best-effort data by definition need not arrive, and transient and persistent data are covered by the durability service.

Once the system is stable, the DDSI2E service keeps track of the existence of remote readers whether or not matching writers exist locally, avoiding this discovery delay and ensuring this is merely a node startup issue.

Setting General/StartupModeDuration to 0s will disable it.

The unit must be specified explicitly. Recognised units: ns, us, ms, s, min, hr, day.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/General/StartupModeDuration
- Format: string
- Default value: 2 s
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

UseIPv6
-------

This element can be used to make DDSI2E service use IPv6 instead of IPv4. This is currently an either/or switch.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/General/UseIPv6
- Format: boolean
- Default value: false
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

Internal
========

The Internal elements deal with a variety of settings that evolving and that are not necessarily fully supported. For the vast majority of the Internal settings, the functionality per-se is supported, but the right to change the way the options control the functionality is reserved. This includes renaming or moving options.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Internal
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1
- Child elements: AccelerateRexmitBlockSize, AggressiveKeepLast1Whc, AssumeMulticastCapable, AuxiliaryBandwidthLimit, BuiltinEndpointSet, ConservativeBuiltinReaderStartup, DDSI2DirectMaxThreads, DefragReliableMaxSamples, DefragUnreliableMaxSamples, DeliveryQueueMaxSamples, ForwardAllMessages, ForwardRemoteData, FragmentSize, GenerateKeyhash, LateAckMode, LeaseDuration, LegacyFragmentation, LogStackTraces, MaxMessageSize, MaxParticipants, MaxQueuedRexmitBytes, MaxQueuedRexmitMessages, MaxSampleSize, MeasureHbToAckLatency, MinimumSocketReceiveBufferSize, MinimumSocketSendBufferSize, MirrorRemoteEntities, NackDelay, PreEmptiveAckDelay, PrimaryReorderMaxSamples, ResponsivenessTimeout, RetransmitMerging, RetransmitMergingPeriod, RetryOnRejectBestEffort, RetryOnRejectDuration, SPDPResponseMaxDelay, ScheduleTimeRounding, SecondaryReorderMaxSamples, SquashParticipants, SuppressSPDPMulticast, SynchronousDeliveryLatencyBound, SynchronousDeliveryPriorityThreshold, UnicastResponseToSPDPMessages, WriterLingerDuration

AccelerateRexmitBlockSize
-------------------------

**Internal** Proxy readers that are assumed to sill be retrieving historical data get this many samples retransmitted when they NACK something, even if some of these samples have sequence numbers outside the set covered by the NACK.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Internal/AccelerateRexmitBlockSize
- Format: integer
- Default value: 0
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

AggressiveKeepLast1Whc
----------------------

**Internal** This element controls whether to drop a reliable sample from a DDSI2E WHC before all readers have acknowledged it as soon as a later sample becomes available. It only affects DCPS data writers with a history QoS setting of KEEP_LAST with depth 1. The default setting, *false*, mimics the behaviour of the OpenSplice RT networking and is necessary to make the behaviour of wait_for_acknowledgements() consistent across the networking services.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Internal/AggressiveKeepLast1Whc
- Format: boolean
- Default value: false
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

AssumeMulticastCapable
----------------------

**Internal** This element controls which network interfaces are assumed to be capable of multicasting even when the interface flags returned by the operating system state it is not (this provides a workaround for some platforms). It is a comma-separated lists of patterns (with ? and * wildcards) against which the interface names are matched.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Internal/AssumeMulticastCapable
- Format: string
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

AuxiliaryBandwidthLimit
-----------------------

**Internal** This element specifies the maximum transmit rate of auxiliary traffic not bound to a specific channel, such as discovery traffic, as well as auxiliary traffic related to a certain channel if that channel has elected to share this global AuxiliaryBandwidthLimit. Bandwidth limiting uses a leaky bucket scheme. The default value "inf" means DDSI2E imposes no limitation, the underlying operating system and hardware will likely limit the maimum transmit rate.

The unit must be specified explicitly. Recognised units: *X*b/s, *X*bps for bits/s or *X*B/s, *X*Bps for bytes/s; where *X* is an optional prefix: k for 10 :sup:`3`, Ki for 2 :sup:`10`, M for 10 :sup:`6`, Mi for 2 :sup:`20`, G for 10 :sup:`9`, Gi for 2 :sup:`30`.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Internal/AuxiliaryBandwidthLimit
- Format: string
- Default value: inf
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

BuiltinEndpointSet
------------------

**Internal** This element controls which participants will have which built-in endpoints for the discovery and liveliness protocols. Valid values are:

- *full*: all participants have all endpoints;
- *writers*: all participants have the writers, but just one has the readers;
- *minimal*: only one participant has built-in endpoints.

The default is *writers*, as this is thought to be compliant and reasonably efficient. *Minimal* may or may not be compliant but is most efficient, and *full* is inefficient but certain to be compliant. See also Internal/ConservativeBuiltinReaderStartup.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Internal/BuiltinEndpointSet
- Format: enumeration
- Default value: writers
- Valid values: full, writers, minimal
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

ConservativeBuiltinReaderStartup
--------------------------------

**Internal** This element forces all DDSI2E built-in discovery-related readers to request all historical data, instead of just one for each "topic". There is no indication that any of the current DDSI implementations requires changing of this setting, but it is conceivable that an implementation might track which participants have been informed of the existence of endpoints and which have not been, refusing communication with those that have "can't" know.

Should it be necessary to hide DDSI2E's shared discovery behaviour, set this to *true* and Internal/BuiltinEndpointSet to *full*.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Internal/ConservativeBuiltinReaderStartup
- Format: boolean
- Default value: false
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

DDSI2DirectMaxThreads
---------------------

**Internal** This element sets the maximum number of extra threads for an experimental, undocumented and unsupported direct mode.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Internal/DDSI2DirectMaxThreads
- Format: integer
- Default value: 1
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

DefragReliableMaxSamples
------------------------

**Internal** This element sets the maximum number of samples that can be defragmneted simultaneously for a reliable writer. This has to be large enough to handle retransmissions of historical data in addition to new samples.

- Format: integer
- Default value: 16
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

DefragUnreliableMaxSamples

- Format: integer
- Default value: 4
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

DeliveryQueueMaxSamples
-----------------------

**Internal** This element controls the Maximum size of a delivery queue, expressed in samples. Once a delivery queue is full, incoming samples destined for that queue are dropped until space becomes available again.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Internal/DeliveryQueueMaxSamples
- Format: integer
- Default value: 256
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

ForwardAllMessages
------------------

**Internal** Forward all messages from a writer, rather than trying to forward each sample only once. The default of trying to forward each sample only once filters out duplicates for writers in multiple partitions under nearly all circumstances, but may still publish the odd duplicate. Note: the current implementation also can lose in contrived test cases, that publish more than 2**32 samples using a single data writer in conjunction with carefully controlled management of the writer history via cooperating local readers.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Internal/ForwardAllMessages
- Format: boolean
- Default value: false
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

ForwardRemoteData
-----------------

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Internal/ForwardRemoteData
- Format: enumeration
- Default value: default
- Valid values: false, default, true
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

FragmentSize
------------

**Internal** This element specifies the size of DDSI sample fragments generated by DDSI2E. Samples larger than FragmentSize are fragmented into fragments of FragmentSize bytes each, except the last one, which may be smaller. The DDSI spec mandates a minimum fragment size of 1025 bytes, but DDSI2E will do whatever size is requested, accepting fragments of which the size is at least the minimum of 1025 and FragmentSize.

The unit must be specified explicitly. Recognised units: B (bytes), kB & KiB (2 :sup:`10` bytes), MB & MiB (2 :sup:`20` bytes), GB & GiB (2 :sup:`30` bytes).

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Internal/FragmentSize
- Format: string
- Default value: 1280 B
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

GenerateKeyhash
---------------

**Internal** When true, include keyhashes in outgoing data for topics with keys.

- Format: boolean
- Default value: false
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

LeaseDuration
-------------

**Internal** This setting controls the default participant lease duration, with 0s (the default) indicating that it is to be derived from the domain ExpiryTime: either 10% or 1s longer, whichever is shortest. 
The unit must be specified explicitly. Recognised units: ns, us, ms, s, min, hr, day.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Internal/LeaseDuration
- Format: string
- Default value: 0 s

- Format: boolean
- Default value: false
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

LogStackTraces
--------------

This element controls whether or not to write stack traces to the DDSI2 trace when a thread fails to make progress (on select platforms only).

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Internal/LogStackTraces
- Format: boolean
- Default value: false
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

MaxMessageSize
--------------

**Internal** This element specifies the maximum size of the UDP payload that DDSI2E will generate. DDSI2E will try to maintain this limit within the bounds of the DDSI specification, which means that in some cases (especially for very low values of MaxMessageSize) larger payloads may sporadically be observed (currently up to 1192 B).

On some networks it may be necessary to set this item to keep the packetsize below the MTU to prevent IP fragmentation. In those cases, it is generally advisable to also consider reducing Internal/FragmentSize.

The unit must be specified explicitly. Recognised units: B (bytes), kB & KiB (2 :sup:`10` bytes), MB & MiB (2 :sup:`20` bytes), GB & GiB (2 :sup:`30` bytes).

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Internal/MaxParticipants
- Format: integer
- Default value: 0
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

MaxQueuedRexmitBytes
--------------------

**Internal** This setting limits the maximum number of bytes queued for retransmission. The default value of 0 is unlimited unless an AuxiliaryBandwidthLimit has been set, in which case it becomes NackDelay * AuxiliaryBandwidthLimit. It must be large enough to contain the largest sample that may need to be retransmitted.

The unit must be specified explicitly. Recognised units: B (bytes), kB & KiB (2 :sup:`10` bytes), MB & MiB (2 :sup:`20` bytes), GB & GiB (2 :sup:`30` bytes).

- Format: integer
- Default value: 200

- Format: string
- Default value: 2147483647 B
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

MeasureHbToAckLatency
---------------------

**Internal** This element enables heartbeat-to-ack latency among DDSI2E services by prepending timestamps to Heartbeat and AckNack messages and calculating round trip times. This is non-standard behaviour. The measured latencies are quite noisy and are currently not used anywhere.

- Format: boolean
- Default value: false
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

MinimumSocketReceiveBufferSize
------------------------------

**Internal** This setting controls the minimum size of socket receive buffers. This setting can only increase the size of the receive buffer, if the operating system by default creates a larger buffer, it is left unchanged.

The unit must be specified explicitly. Recognised units: B (bytes), kB & KiB (2 :sup:`10` bytes), MB & MiB (2 :sup:`20` bytes), GB & GiB (2 :sup:`30` bytes).

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Internal/MinimumSocketReceiveBufferSize
- Format: string
- Default value: default
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

MinimumSocketSendBufferSize
---------------------------

**Internal** This setting controls the minimum size of socket send buffers. This setting can only increase the size of the send buffer, if the operating system by default creates a larger buffer, it is left unchanged.

The unit must be specified explicitly. Recognised units: B (bytes), kB & KiB (2 :sup:`10` bytes), MB & MiB (2 :sup:`20` bytes), GB & GiB (2 :sup:`30` bytes).

- Format: enumeration
- Default value: default
- Valid values: false, default, true
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

NackDelay
---------

**Internal** This setting controls the delay between receipt of a HEARTBEAT indicating missing samples and a NACK (ignored when the HEARTBEAT requires an answer). However, no NACK is sent if a NACK had been scheduled already for a response earlier than the delay requests: then that NACK will incorporate the latest information.

The unit must be specified explicitly. Recognised units: ns, us, ms, s, min, hr, day.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Internal/NackDelay
- Format: string
- Default value: 10 ms
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

PreEmptiveAckDelay

PrimaryReorderMaxSamples
------------------------

**Internal** This element sets the maximum size in samples of a primary re-order administration.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Internal/PrimaryReorderMaxSamples
- Format: integer
- Default value: 64
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

ResponsivenessTimeout
---------------------

**Internal** This element controls for how long an unresponsive reader can block the transmit thread by failing to acknowledge data when a writer's DDSI2E WHC is full. If after this time the writer's WHC has not shrunk to below the low-water mark, the reader is considered unresponsive and degraded to unreliable. It will be restored to reliable service once it resumes acknowledging ing samples.

The unit must be specified explicitly. Recognised units: ns, us, ms, s, min, hr, day.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Internal/ResponsivenessTimeout
- Format: string
- Default value: 1 s

RetransmitMerging
-----------------

**Internal** This elements controls the addressing and timing of retransmits. Possible values are:

- *never*: retransmit only to the NACK-ing reader;
- *adaptive*: attempt to combine retransmits needed for reliability, but send historical (transient-local) data to the requesting reader only;
- *always*: do not distinguish between different causes, always try to merge.

The default is *adaptive*. See also Internal/RetransmitMergingPeriod.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Internal/RetransmitMerging
- Format: enumeration
- Default value: adaptive
- Valid values: never, adaptive, always
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

RetransmitMergingPeriod
-----------------------

**Internal** This setting determines the size of the time window in which a NACK of some sample is ignored because a retransmit of that sample has been multicasted too recently. This setting has no effect of unicasted retransmits.

See also Internal/RetransmitMerging.

The unit must be specified explicitly. Recognised units: ns, us, ms, s, min, hr, day.

**Internal** Whether or not to locally retry pusing a received best-effort sample into the reader caches when resource limits are reached.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Internal/RetryOnRejectBestEffort
- Format: boolean
- Default value: false
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

RetryOnRejectDuration
---------------------

**Internal** How long to keep locally retrying pushing a received sample into the reader caches when resource limits are reached. Default is dependent on Internal/LateAckMode: if the latter is false, it is 80% of Internal/ResponsivenessTimeout, otherwise it is 0.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Internal/SPDPResponseMaxDelay
- Format: string
- Default value: 0 ms
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

ScheduleTimeRounding
--------------------

**Internal** This setting allows the timing of scheduled events to be rounded up so that more events can be handled in a single cycle of the event queue. The default is 0 and causes no rounding at all, i.e. are scheduled exactly, whereas a value of 10ms would mean that events are rounded up to the nearest 10 milliseconds.

The unit must be specified explicitly. Recognised units: ns, us, ms, s, min, hr, day.

**Internal** This element controls whether DDSI2E advertises all the domain participants it serves in DDSI (when set to *false*), or rather only one domain participant (the one corresponding to the DDSI2E process; when set to *true*). In the latter case DDSI2E becomes the virtual owner of all readers and writers of all domain participants, dramatically reducing discovery traffic.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Internal/SquashParticipants
- Format: boolean
- Default value: false
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

SuppressSPDPMulticast
---------------------

**Internal** The element controls whether the mandatory multicasting of the participant discovery packets occurs. Completely disabling multicasting requires this element be set to *true*, and generally requires explicitly listing peers to ping for unicast discovery.

See also General/AllowMulticast.

- Format: boolean
- Default value: false
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

SynchronousDeliveryLatencyBound
-------------------------------

**Internal** This element controls whether samples sent by a writer with QoS settings transport_priority >= SynchronousDeliveryPriorityThreshold and a latency_budget at most this element's value will be delivered synchronously from the "recv" thread, all others will be delivered asynchronously through delivery queues. This reduces latency at the expense of aggregate bandwidth.

Valid values are finite durations with an explicit unit or the keyword 'inf' for infinity. Recognised units: ns, us, ms, s, min, hr, day.

Security
========

The Security element specifies DDSI2E security profiles that can be used to encrypt traffic mapped to DDSI2E network partitions.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Security
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

SecurityProfile
---------------

This element defines a DDSI2E security profile.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Security/SecurityProfile
- Occurrences min-max: 0-*
- Required attributes: Name
- Optional attributes: Cipher, CipherKey

Cipher
^^^^^^

This attribute specifies the cipher to be used for encrypting traffic over network partitions secured by this security profile. The possible ciphers are:

- *aes128*: AES with a 128-bit key;
- *aes192*: AES with a 192-bit key;
- *aes256*: AES with a 256-bit key;
- *blowfish*: the Blowfish cipher with a 128 bit key;
- *null*: no encryption;

SHA1 is used on conjunction with all ciphers except "null" to ensure data integrity.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Security/SecurityProfile/Cipher
- Format: enumeration
- Default value: null
- Valid values: null, blowfish, aes128, aes192, aes256
- Required: false

CipherKey
^^^^^^^^^

The CipherKey attribute is used to define the secret key required by the cipher selected using the Cipher attribtue. The value can be a URI referencing an external file containing the secret key, or the secret key can be defined in-place as a string value.

The key must be specified as a hexadecimal string with each character representing 4 bits of the key. E.g., 1ABC represents the 16-bit key 0001 1010 1011 1100. The key should not follow a well-known pattern and must exactly match the key length of the selected cipher.

A malformed key will cause the security profile to be marked as invalid, and disable all network partitions secured by the (invalid) security profile to prevent information leaks.

As all DDS applications require read access to the XML configuration file, for security reasons it is recommended to store the secret key in an external file in the file system, referenced by its URI. The file should be protected against read and write access from other users on the host.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Security/SecurityProfile/CipherKey
- Format: string
- Default value: ""
- Required: false

Name
^^^^

This attribute specifies the name of this DDSI2E security profile. Two security profiles cannot have the same name.

- Format: integer
- Default value: 20000
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

LocalEndpoints
--------------

This element specifies the expected maximum number of endpoints local to one DDSI2E service. Underestimating this number will have a significant performance impact, but will not affect correctness; signficantly overestimating it will cause more memory to be used than necessary.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Sizing/LocalEndpoints
- Format: integer
- Default value: 1000
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

NetworkQueueSize
----------------

This element specifies the maximum number of samples in the network queue. Write/dispose operations add samples to this queue, the DDSI2E service drains it. Larger values allow large bursts of writes to occur without forcing synchronization between the application and the DDSI2E service, but do introduce the potential for longer latencies and increase the maximum amount of memory potentially occupied by messages in the queue.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Sizing/NetworkQueueSize
- Format: integer
- Default value: 1000
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

ReceiveBufferChunkSize

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Threads/Thread/StackSize
- Format: string
- Default value: default
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

Tracing
=======

The Tracing element controls the amount and type of information that is written into the tracing log by the DDSI service. This is useful to track the DDSI service during application development.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Tracing
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1
- Child elements: AppendToFile, EnableCategory, OutputFile, PacketCaptureFile, Timestamps, Verbosity

AppendToFile
------------

This option specifies whether the output is to be appended to an existing log file. The default is to create a new log file each time, which is generally the best option if a detailed log is generated.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Tracing/AppendToFile
- Format: boolean
- Default value: false
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

EnableCategory
--------------

This element enables individual logging categories. These are enabled in addition to those enabled by Tracing/Verbosity. Recognised categories are:

- *fatal*: all fatal errors, errors causing immediate termination

- *timing*: periodic reporting of CPU loads per thread
- *traffic*: periodic reporting of total outgoing data

In addition, there is the keyword *trace* that enables all but *radmin*
.
The categorisation of tracing output is incomplete and hence most of the verbosity levels and categories are not of much use in the current release. This is an ongoing process and here we describe the target situation rather than the current situation. Currently, the most useful is *trace*.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Tracing/EnableCategory
- Format: string
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

OutputFile
----------

This option specifies where the logging is printed to. Note that *stdout* and *stderr* are treated as special values, representing "standard out" and "standard error" respectively. No file is created unless logging categories are enabled using the Tracing/Verbosity or Tracing/EnabledCategory settings.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Tracing/OutputFile
- Format: string
- Default value: ddsi2.log
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

PacketCaptureFile
-----------------

This option specifies the file to which received and sent packets will be logged in the "pcap" format suitable for analysis using common networking tools, such as WireShark. IP and UDP headers are ficitious, in particular the destination address of received packets. The TTL may be used to distinguish between sent and received packets: it is 255 for sent packets and 128 for received ones. Currently IPv4 only.

- Full path: /DDSI2EService/Tracing/PacketCaptureFile
- Format: string
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

Timestamps
----------

- Default value: true
- Required: false

Verbosity
---------

This element enables standard groups of categories, based on a desired verbosity level. This is in addition to the categories enabled by the Tracing/EnableCategory setting. Recognised verbosity levels and the categories they map to are:

- *none*: no DDSI2E log
- *severe*: error and fatal
- *warning*: *severe* + warning
- *info*: equivalent to *warning*
- *config*: *info* + config
- *fine*: *config* + discovery
- *finer*: *fine* + traffic, timing & info
- *finest*: *finer* + trace

While *none* prevents any message from being written to a DDSI2 log file, warnings and errors are still logged in the ospl-info.log and ospl-error.log files.

The categorisation of tracing output is incomplete and hence most of the verbosity levels and categories are not of much use in the current release. This is an ongoing process and here we describe the target situation rather than the current situation. Currently, the most useful verbosity levels are *config* and *finest*.

LeasePeriod
-----------

                    This element determines the maximum amount of time in which a
                    connected client must update its lease. This can be done
                    implicitly by calling any function or explicitly by calling
                    the update lease function. The Tuner tool will automatically
                    update its lease when it is connected to the Tuner service.
                    This ensures that all resources are cleaned up automatically
                    if the client fails to update its lease within this period.

DdsToDbms
=========

                This element specifies the configuration properties concerning DDS to DBMS bridging.

- Full path: /DbmsConnectService/DdsToDbms
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1
- Optional attributes: replication_mode

replication_mode
----------------

                    This attribute specifies the default replication mode for
                    all NameSpaces in the *DdsToDbms* element.

                    When replicating databases through DDS, the *NameSpace*
                    elements in the *DbmsToDds* and *DdsToDbms* elements
                    map a Table and Topic circularly. To prevent data-modifications
                    from continuously cascading, modifications made by the
                    DBMSConnect service itself should not trigger new updates
                    in the DBMS nor in the DDS.

                    In replication mode, the DBMS-connect service ignores
                    samples that were published by itself. (Currently that means
                    that everything that is published on the same node as the
                    DBMSConnect Service is considered to be of DBMSConnect
                    origin and therefore ignored). That way, replication of
                    changes that were copied from Dbms to DDS back into Dbms
                    is avoided.

                    **WARNING**: This setting does not avoid replication
                    of changes that were copied from DDS to Dbms back into DDS.
                    For that purpose, the *replication_user* attribute of the
                    *DbmsToDds* or *DbmsToDds/NameSpace* elements should
                    be set appropriately as well!

odbc
^^^^

                        The service dynamically loads an ODBC library at runtime. This attribute
                        specifies the name of the ODBC library to be loaded. Platform specific
                        pre- and postfixes and extensions are automatically added.

                        If this attribute is not provided, the service will attempt to load the
                        generic ODBC library. The resulting behaviour is dependent on the platform
                        on which the DbmsConnect Service is running.

                        represents any sequence of characters and a '?' represents one
                        single character.

                        This expression is used to specify the DDS partition(s) from which
                        DDS samples must be 'bridged' to the DBMS domain.

                        represents any sequence of characters and a '?' represents one
                        single character.

                        This expression is used to specify the topics from which DDS
                        samples must be 'bridged' to the DBMS domain.  For every matching
                        topic encountered in one or more of the specified partitions, it
                        creates a separate table in the DBMS. The table name will match that
                        of the topic, unless specified otherwise in the *table* attribute
                        of a *Mapping* element.

                        defaults to false

                        When replicating databases through DDS, the *NameSpace*
                        elements in the *DbmsToDds* and *DdsToDbms* elements
                        map a Table and Topic circularly. To prevent data-modifications
                        from continuously cascading, modifications made by the
                        DBMSConnect service itself should not trigger new updates
                        in the DBMS.

                        In replication mode, the DBMS-connect service ignores
                        samples that were published by itself. (Currently that means
                        that everything that is published on the same node as the
                        DBMSConnect Service is considered to be of DBMSConnect
                        origin and therefore ignored). That way, replication of
                        changes that were copied from Dbms to DDS back into Dbms
                        is avoided.

                        **WARNING**: This setting does not avoid replication
                        of changes that were copied from DDS to Dbms back into DDS.
                        For that purpose, the *replication_user* attribute of the
                        *DbmsToDds* or *DbmsToDds/NameSpace* elements should
                        be set appropriately as well!

Mapping
^^^^^^^

                            This element specifies a modification to the way that the service handles
                            a pre-configured set of data within the specified NameSpace. Its attributes
                            are used to configure the responsibilities of the service concerning the
                            bridging of data from DDS to DBMS.

table
~~~~~

                            This attribute specifies an alternative name for the table that
                            must be associated with the topic. By default the table name is
                            equal to the topic name.

query
~~~~~

                            This attribute specifies an SQL query expression. Only DDS data
                            that matches the query will be bridged to the DBMS domain. This
                            is realized by means of a DCPS query condition. The default value
                            is an empty string, representing all available samples of the

filter
~~~~~~

                            This attribute specifies an SQL content filter. Only DDS data
                            that matches the filter will be bridged to the DBMS domain. This
                            is realized by means of a DCPS ContentFilteredTopic. The default
                            value is an empty string, representing all available samples of

- Optional attributes: publish_initial_data, event_table_policy, trigger_policy, replication_user

publish_initial_data
--------------------

                    This attribute specifies the default behaviour with respect to publishing
                    initially available data in the DBMS to the DDS for all NameSpace elements
                    in the current DbmsToDds element. If not specified, it defaults to true.
                    The value of this attribute is ignored when the corresponding
                    event_table_policy is set to NONE.

- Full path: /DbmsConnectService/DbmsToDds/publish_initial_data
- Format: boolean
- Default value: true
- Required: false

event_table_policy
------------------

                    This attribute specifies the default setting of the event table policy for all *NameSpace* elements in the current *DbmsToDds* element.

                    An event table (sometimes referred to as 'change table' or 'shadow table') is a support-table that is slaved to an application-table, adding some status flags that are under the control of a trigger mechanism that responds to creation/modification/ deletion events in the application-table.

                    The following policies are currently supported:

                    
                    - **FULL**: *(default)* An 'event table' will always be created when the service connects, and will always be deleted when the service disconnects. In this mode, the service will replace the table if it already exists.
                    - **LAZY**: An 'event table' will only be created if it is not available when the service connects, and it will not be deleted when the service disconnects.
                    - **NONE**: An 'event table' will neither be created nor deleted by the service. For each specified *NameSpace*, the service will poll for the existence of a consistent table with a frequency specified in the coresponding *update_frequency* attribute. It will start using the table as soon as it is available. With this policy set, no initial data will be published regardless of the value of the applicable *publish_initial_data* attribute.

- Full path: /DbmsConnectService/DbmsToDds/event_table_policy
- Format: enumeration
- Default value: FULL
- Valid values: FULL, LAZY, NONE
- Required: false

trigger_policy
--------------

                    This attribute specifies the default trigger policy for all *NameSpace* elements in the current *DbmsToDds* element.

                    Triggers are used to to update the event table in case of creation/modification/ deletion events on the application-table. 

                    The following policies are currently supported:

                    
                    - **FULL**: *(default)* Triggers will always be created when the service connects, and will always be deleted when the service disconnects. In this mode, the service will replace the triggers if they already exists.
                    - **LAZY**: Triggers will only be created if they are not available when the service connects, and will not be deleted when the service disconnects.
                    - **NONE**: Triggers will neither be created nor deleted by the service. This allows you to build your own custom triggering mechanism.

- Full path: /DbmsConnectService/DbmsToDds/trigger_policy
- Format: enumeration
- Default value: FULL
- Valid values: FULL, LAZY, NONE
- Required: false

replication_user
----------------

                    This attribute specifies the default replication user for
                    all *NameSpace* elements in the current *DdsToDbms*
                    element.

                    When replicating databases through DDS, the *NameSpace*
                    elements in the *DbmsToDds* and *DdsToDbms* elements
                    map a Table and Topic circularly. To prevent data-modifications
                    from continuously cascading, modifications made by the
                    service itself should not trigger new updates in the
                    DBMS nor in the DDS.

                    To distinguish between DBMS updates coming from an
                    application and DBMS updates coming from DDS, an extra
                    database user (the replication user) has to be introduced
                    that differs from the application users. That way,
                    replication of changes that were copied from DDS to Dbms
                    back into DDS is avoided. The replication_user attribute
                    specifies the user name of that replication user. An empty
                    string (default value) indicates that there is no separate
                    replication user.

                    **WARNING**: This setting does not avoid replication
                    of changes that were copied from Dbms to DDS back into Dbms.
                    For that purpose, the *replication_mode* attribute of
                    the *DssToDbms* or *DssToDbms/NameSpace* elements
                    should be set appropriately as well!

name
^^^^

                        The name of the namespace. If not specified, the namespace
                        will be named "(nameless)".

- Full path: /DbmsConnectService/DbmsToDds/NameSpace/name
- Format: string
- Default value: (nameless)
- Required: false

odbc
^^^^

                        The service dynamically loads an ODBC library at runtime. This attribute
                        specifies the name of the ODBC library to be loaded. Platform specific
                        pre- and postfixes and extensions are automatically added.

                        If this attribute is not provided, the service will attempt to load the
                        generic ODBC library. The resulting behaviour is dependent on the platform
                        on which the DbmsConnect Service is running.

partition
^^^^^^^^^

                        This attribute specifies an expression represents one or more DDS partitions.
                        It is allowed to use wildcards in the expression: a '*' represents any
                        sequence of characters and a '?' represents one single character.

                        This expression is used to specify the DDS partition(s) where DBMS records
                        will be written to as DDS samples by the service.

- Full path: /DbmsConnectService/DbmsToDds/NameSpace/partition
- Format: string

table
^^^^^

                        This attribute specifies an expression that represents one or more DBMS
                        table names.  It is allowed to use wildcards in the expression: a '*'
                        represents any sequence of characters and a '?' represents one single
                        character.

                        This expression is used to specify the tables from which DBMS data must
                        be 'bridged' to the DDS domain.

update_frequency
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

                        This attribute specifies the frequency (in Hz) at which
                        the service will update the DDS domain with DBMS data.
                        By default, it is 2.0Hz. Event-based updates are not
                        supported. If 0.0Hz is specified, the default of 2.0Hz
                        will be used.

- Full path: /DbmsConnectService/DbmsToDds/NameSpace/update_frequency
- Default value: 2.0
- Required: false

dsn
^^^

                        Represents the Data Source Name, that represents the DBMS where
                        the service must bridge the DDS data from.

- Full path: /DbmsConnectService/DbmsToDds/NameSpace/dsn
- Format: string

usr
^^^

                        Represents the user name that is used when connecting to the DBMS.

publish_initial_data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

                        This attribute specifies the default behaviour with respect to publishing
                        initially available data in the DBMS to the DDS for all *Mapping*
                        elements in the current *NameSpace* element. If not specified, the value
                        will be inherited from the *publish_initial_data* of the parent
                        *DbmsToDds* element, which defaults to true. The value of this attribute
                        is ignored when the corresponding *event_table_policy* is set to NONE.

force_key_equality
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

                        This attribute specifies the default setting for *Mapping* elements
                        in the current *NameSpace* element with regard to the enforcement of
                        key equality between table and topic definitions. If true, key definitions
                        from the table and topic must match, otherwise key definitions may differ.

event_table_policy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

                        This attribute specifies the default setting of the event table policy for all *Mapping* elements in the current *NameSpace* element. If not specified, the value will be inherited from the *event_table_policy* of the parent *DbmsToDds* element, which if not explicitly specified defaults to FULL.

                        An event table (sometimes referred to as 'change table' or 'shadow table') is a support-table that is slaved to an application-table, adding some status flags that are under the control of a trigger mechanism that responds to creation/modification/ deletion events in the application-table.

                        The following policies are currently supported:

                        - **FULL**: *(default)* Triggers will always be created when the service connects, and will always be deleted when the service disconnects. In this mode, the service will replace the triggers if they already exists.
                        - **LAZY**: Triggers will only be created if they are not available when the service connects, and will not be deleted when the service disconnects.
                        - **NONE**: Triggers will neither be created nor deleted by the service. This allows you to build your own custom triggering mechanism.

catalog
^^^^^^^

                        Represents the catalog that is used when communicating with the DBMS.

replication_user
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

                        This attribute specifies the default replication user for
                        all *Mapping* elements in the current *NameSpace*
                        element. If not specified, the value will be inherited from
                        the *replication_user* of the parent *DbmsToDds* element,
                        which by default has no separate replication user specified.

                        When replicating databases through DDS, the *NameSpace*
                        elements in the *DbmsToDds* and *DdsToDbms* elements
                        map a Table and Topic circularly. To prevent data-modifications
                        from continuously cascading, modifications made by the
                        service itself should not trigger new updates in the
                        DBMS nor in the DDS.

                        To distinguish between DBMS updates coming from an
                        application and DBMS updates coming from DDS, an extra

                        back into DDS is avoided. The replication_user attribute
                        specifies the user name of that replication user. An empty
                        string (default value) indicates that there is no separate
                        replication user.

                        **WARNING**: This setting does not avoid replication
                        of changes that were copied from Dbms to DDS back into Dbms.
                        For that purpose, the *replication_mode* attribute of
                        the *DssToDbms* or *DssToDbms/NameSpace* elements

table
~~~~~

                            This attribute specifies the name of the table where the Mapping applies to.

- Full path: /DbmsConnectService/DbmsToDds/NameSpace/Mapping/table
- Format: string
- Default value: n/a
- Required: true

topic
~~~~~

                            This attribute specifies an alternative name for the topic that
                            must be associated with the table. By default the topic name is
                            equal to the table name.

- Full path: /DbmsConnectService/DbmsToDds/NameSpace/Mapping/topic
- Format: string
- Default value: ""
- Required: false

query
~~~~~

                            Optional DBMS query expression. Only DBMS data that matches the
                            query will be bridged to the DDS domain. This is realized by
                            means of a SQL query. The default value is an empty string,
                            representing all available data in the selected table.

- Full path: /DbmsConnectService/DbmsToDds/NameSpace/Mapping/query
- Format: string
- Default value: ""
- Required: false

publish_initial_data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                        This attribute specifies the behaviour with respect to publishing the
                        initially available data specified in the current *Mapping* element
                        from DBMS to DDS. If not specified, the value will be inherited from
                        the *publish_initial_data* of the parent *NameSpace* element,
                        which if not explicitly specified inherits from the *publish_initial_data*
                        of the parent *DbmsToDds* element, which defaults to true.
                        The value of this attribute is ignored when the corresponding
                        *event_table_policy* is set to NONE.

- Full path: /DbmsConnectService/DbmsToDds/NameSpace/Mapping/publish_initial_data
- Format: boolean
- Default value: true
- Required: false

force_key_equality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                           This attribute specifies the enforcement of key equality between table
                           and topic definitions. If true, key definitions from the table and
                           topic must match, otherwise key definitions may differ. If not specified,
                           the value will be inherited from the *force_key_equality* of the parent
                           *NameSpace* element, which if not explicitly specified defaults to true.

- Full path: /DbmsConnectService/DbmsToDds/NameSpace/Mapping/force_key_equality
- Format: boolean
- Default value: true
- Required: false

event_table_policy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                        This attribute specifies the event table policy in the current *Mapping* element. If not specified, the value will be inherited from the *event_table_policy* of the parent *NameSpace* element, which if not explicitly specified inherits from the *event_table_policy* of the parent *DbmsToDds* element, which defaults to FULL.

                        An event table (sometimes referred to as 'change table' or 'shadow table') is a support-table that is slaved to an application-table, adding some status flags that are under the control of a trigger mechanism that responds to creation/modification/ deletion events in the application-table.

                        The following policies are currently supported:

                        
                        - **FULL**: An 'event table' will always be created when the service connects, and will always be deleted when the service disconnects. In this mode, the service will replace the table if it already exists.
                        - **LAZY**: An 'event table' will only be created if it is not available when the service connects, and it will not be deleted when the service disconnects.
                        - **NONE**: An 'event table' will neither be created nor deleted by the service. For the specified table, the service will poll with a frequency specified in the coresponding *update_frequency* attribute of the parent *NameSpace*. It will start using the table as soon as it is available. With this policy set, no initial data will be published regardless of the value of the applicable *publish_initial_data* attribute.

- Full path: /DbmsConnectService/DbmsToDds/NameSpace/Mapping/event_table_policy
- Format: enumeration
- Default value: FULL
- Valid values: FULL, LAZY, NONE
- Required: false

trigger_policy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                        This attribute specifies the trigger policy for the current *Mapping* element. If not specified, the value will be inherited from the *trigger_policy* of the parent *DbmsToDds* element, which if not explicitly specified inherits from the *trigger_policy* of the parent *DbmsToDds* element, which defaults to FULL.

                        Triggers are used to to update the event table in case of creation/modification/ deletion events on the application-table.

                        The following policies are currently supported:

                        
                        - **FULL**: *(default)* Triggers will always be created when the service connects, and will always be deleted when the service disconnects. In this mode, the service will replace the triggers if they already exists.
                        - **LAZY**: Triggers will only be created if they are not available when the service connects, and will not be deleted when the service disconnects.
                        - **NONE**: Triggers will neither be created nor deleted by the service. This allows you to build your own custom triggering mechanism.

- Full path: /DbmsConnectService/DbmsToDds/NameSpace/Mapping/trigger_policy
- Format: enumeration
- Default value: FULL
- Valid values: FULL, LAZY, NONE
- Required: false

Tracing
=======

                This element controls the amount and type of information that is
                written into the tracing log file by the DbmsConnect Service.
                This is useful to track the DbmsConnect Service during application
                development. In the runtime system it should be turned off.

- Full path: /DbmsConnectService/Tracing
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1
- Child elements: OutputFile, Timestamps, Verbosity

OutputFile
----------

                    This element specifies where the logging is printed to. Note that
                    "stdout" and "stderr" are considered legal values that represent
                    "standard out" and "standard error" respectively. The default
                    value is an empty string, indicating that all tracing is disabled.

- Required attributes: name

name
====

        This attribute identifies a configuration for the Record and Replay Service by name.
        Multiple service configurations can be specified in one single resource file. The actual
        applicable configuration is determined by the value of the *name* attribute, which
        must match the one specified under the *OpenSplice/Domain/Service[@name]* in the
        configuration of the Domain Service.

- Full path: /RnRService/name

        This element controls the characteristics of the Watchdog thread.

- Full path: /RnRService/Watchdog
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

Scheduling
----------

          This element specifies the type of OS scheduling class will be
          used by the thread that announces its liveliness periodically.

- Full path: /RnRService/Watchdog/Scheduling
- Occurrences min-max: 1-1
- Child elements: Priority, Class

Priority
^^^^^^^^

            This element specifies the thread priority that will be used by the
            watchdog thread. Only priorities that are supported by the
            underlying operating system can be assigned to this element.
            The user may need special privileges from the underlying operating
            system to be able to assign some of the privileged priorities.

- Full path: /RnRService/Watchdog/Scheduling/Priority

- Required: false

Class
^^^^^

            This element specifies the thread scheduling class that will be used by
            the watchdog thread. The user may need the appropriate privileges from

Storage
=======

        This element specifies a storage to use for recording and/or replaying data.
        Currently the supported storage backends are XML and CDR.
        Note that storages can also be created, or their properties modified, by Record and Replay configuration-commands.
        These commands use the same syntax to specify configuration data as the OpenSplice configuration file,
        so the description given here also applies to commands.

- Full path: /RnRService/Storage
- Occurrences min-max: 0-*
- Required attributes: name

name
----

          The name used to identify the storage in Record and Replay commands.

- Full path: /RnRService/Storage/name
- Format: string
- Default value: default
- Required: true

rr_storageAttrXML
-----------------

          Attributes describing an XML storage.

- Full path: /RnRService/Storage/rr_storageAttrXML
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1
- Child elements: filename, MaxFileSize

filename
^^^^^^^^

            The filename template used for files that comprise a storage.

            the storage files are created in the current working directory.

- Full path: /RnRService/Storage/rr_storageAttrXML/filename
- Format: string
- Default value: rnr-storage.dat
- Occurrences min-max: 1-1

MaxFileSize
^^^^^^^^^^^

            The maximum size per storage file. When approaching the maximum size while recording,
            a new storage file is automatically created with a sequence number appended to the filename.
            The active file is also switched transparently while replaying from a storage that contains
            multiple data files.
            The human-readable option lets the user postfix the value with K(ilobyte), M(egabyte) or
            G(igabtye). For example, 10M results in 10485760 bytes.
            This element is optional, when omitted or when 0 is configured, the file size is not monitored
            by the service and limited only by filesystem and/or platform-specific limits.

- Full path: /RnRService/Storage/rr_storageAttrXML/MaxFileSize
- Default value: 0
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

rr_storageAttrCDR
-----------------

          Attributes describing an CDR storage.

- Full path: /RnRService/Storage/rr_storageAttrCDR
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1
- Child elements: filename, MaxFileSize

filename
^^^^^^^^

            The filename template used for files that comprise a storage.
            The filename may contain a relative or absolute path. If a path is omitted,
            the storage files are created in the current working directory.

- Full path: /RnRService/Storage/rr_storageAttrCDR/filename
- Format: string
- Default value: rnr-storage.dat
- Occurrences min-max: 1-1

MaxFileSize
^^^^^^^^^^^

            The maximum size per storage file. When approaching the maximum size while recording,
            a new storage file is automatically created with a sequence number appended to the filename.
            The active file is also switched transparently while replaying from a storage that contains
            multiple data files.
            The human-readable option lets the user postfix the value with K(ilobyte), M(egabyte) or
            G(igabtye). For example, 10M results in 10485760 bytes.
            This element is optional, when omitted or when 0 is configured, the file size is not monitored
            by the service and limited only by filesystem and/or platform-specific limits.

- Full path: /RnRService/Storage/rr_storageAttrCDR/MaxFileSize
- Default value: 0
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

Statistics
----------

          Maintain and optionally publish statistics for this storage.

- Full path: /RnRService/Storage/Statistics
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1
- Optional attributes: enabled, publish_interval, reset

enabled
^^^^^^^

            This attribute specifies if statistics should be maintained for this storage.

- Full path: /RnRService/Storage/Statistics/enabled
- Format: boolean
- Default value: true
- Occurrences min-max: 1-1
- Required: false

publish_interval
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

            This attribute specifies the publication interval of the statistics belonging to this storage,
            in a Record and Replay storage-statistics topic. The publish interval is a value in seconds but may also
            be set to -1. This means the statistics are published when the storage is closed. Note that a value of 0 means
            statistics are never published.

- Full path: /RnRService/Storage/Statistics/publish_interval
- Format: integer
- Default value: 30
- Occurrences min-max: 1-1
- Required: false

reset
^^^^^

            This attribute allows to reset the current values of statistics belonging to the storage. Note
            that this only makes sense in a configuration-command for an existing storage, since new storages created
            from the OpenSplice configuration file always start out with empty statistics.

- Full path: /RnRService/Storage/Statistics/reset
- Format: boolean
- Default value: false
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1
- Required: false

- Child elements: OutputFile, AppendToFile, Verbosity, EnableCategory

OutputFile
----------

          This option specifies where the logging is printed to.
          Note that "stdout" is considered a legal value that represents "standard out"
          and "stderr" is a legal value representing "standard error".

- Full path: /RnRService/Tracing/OutputFile
- Format: string
- Default value: rnr.log
- Occurrences min-max: 1-1

AppendToFile
------------

          This option specifies whether the output is to be appended to an existing log file.
          The default is to overwrite the log file if it exists.

- Full path: /RnRService/Tracing/AppendToFile
- Format: boolean
- Default value: false
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

Verbosity
---------

          This element specifies the verbosity level of the logging information.
          The higher the level, the more (detailed) information will be logged.

- Full path: /RnRService/Tracing/Verbosity
- Format: enumeration
- Default value: INFO
- Valid values: SEVERE, WARNING, INFO, CONFIG, FINE, FINER, FINEST, NONE
- Occurrences min-max: 0-1

EnableCategory
--------------

          This option allows to enable specific logging categories independently of the
          categories selected by specifiying a verbosity level.
          Multiple categories, seperated by a comma, can be supplied.
          The following categories are available:
          
            - **FATAL**: Errors that are potentially fatal for the correct operation of the service.
