.. Nothing particularly untoward here
   But the thought occurs that maybe we should offer
   ``README.rst`` as well as a MarkDown version...

Examples Source Code
====================

All the ISO C++ examples presented throughout the Tutorial are available online
at https://github.com/PrismTech/dds-tutorial-cpp-ex.

The ``README.md`` provides all the information necessary to install and
run the examples.

Getting a DDS Implementation
============================

At the time of writing, the only open source DDS
implementation that supports the new ISO C++ API is *Vortex OpenSplice*, which
is freely available at http://www.opensplice.org.

Commercial versions of Vortex OpenSplice and Vortex Lite are also available
which support the ISO C++ API from http://prismtech.com/vortex.

C++11 Considerations
====================

Although some of the examples in this Tutorial take advantage of C++11,
the new C++ API can also be used with C++03 compilers. That said, if 
you have the opportunity to use a C++11 compiler, then there are some
additional aspects of the language that can be enabled.
