*The Tuner Service provides a remote interface to the monitor and control facilities
of OpenSplice by means of the SOAP protocol. This enables the OpenSplice Tuner
to remotely monitor and control, from any reachable location, OpenSplice services
as well as the applications that use OpenSplice for the distribution of their data.*

The exact fulfilment of these responsibilities is determined by the configuration of
the Tuner Service. There is a detailed description of the available configuration 
parameters and their purpose in the  :ref:`Configuration <Configuration>` section,
starting at the section on ``//OpenSplice/NetworkService/Tracing``.
