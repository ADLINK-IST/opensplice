<p><em>The purpose and scope of the</em> Data-Distribution Service Interoperability Wire
Protocol <em>is to ensure that applications based on different vendors’ implementations
of DDS can interoperate. The protocol was standardized by the OMG in 2008, and
was designed to meet the specific requirements of data-distribution systems.</em></p>
<p>Features of the <em>DDSI</em> protocol include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Performance and Quality-of-Service properties to enable best-effort and
reliable publish-subscribe communications for real-time applications over
standard IP networks.</li>
<li>Fault tolerance to allow the creation of networks without single points of failure.</li>
<li>Plug-and-play Connectivity so that new applications and services are
automatically discovered and applications can join and leave the network at any
time without the need for reconfiguration.</li>
<li>Configurability to allow balancing the requirements for reliability and timeliness
for each data delivery.</li>
<li>Scalability to enable systems to potentially scale to very large networks.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>DDSI-Extended</em> (DDSI2E) is an extended version of the DDSI2 networking service,
giving extra features for:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>Network partitions</em>: Network partitions provide the ability to use alternative
multicast addresses for combinations of DCPS topics and partitions to separate
out traffic flows, for example for routing or load reduction.</li>
<li><em>Security</em>: Encryption can be configured per network partition. This enables
configuring encrypted transmission for subsets of the data.</li>
<li><em>Bandwidth limiting and traffic scheduling</em>: Any number of ‘network channels’
can be defined, each with an associated transport priority. Application data is
routed via the network channel with the best matching priority. For each network
channel, outgoing bandwidth limits can be set and the IP ‘differentiated services’
options can be controlled.</li>
</ul>
<p>The remainder of this section gives background on these two services and describes
how the various mechanisms and their configuration parameters interact.</p>

<span id="id2"></span><h2>7.1. DDSI Concepts<a class="headerlink" href="#ddsi-concepts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The DDSI 2.1 standard is very intimately related to the DDS 1.2 standard, with a
clear correspondence between the entities in DDSI and those in DCPS. However,
this correspondence is not one-to-one.</p>
<p>In this section we give a high-level description of the concepts of the DDSI
specification, with hardly any reference to the specifics of the OpenSplice
implementation, DDSI2, which are addressed in subsequent sections. This
division was chosen to aid readers interested in interoperability to understand
where the specification ends and the OpenSplice implementation begins.</p>
<div class="section" id="mapping-of-dcps-domains-to-ddsi-domains">
<span id="id3"></span><h3>7.1.1. Mapping of DCPS domains to DDSI domains<a class="headerlink" href="#mapping-of-dcps-domains-to-ddsi-domains" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In DCPS, a domain is uniquely identified by a non-negative integer, the domain id.
DDSI maps this domain id to UDP/IP port numbers to be used for communicating
with the peer nodes — these port numbers are particularly important for the
discovery protocol — and this mapping of domain ids to UDP/IP port numbers
ensures that accidental cross-domain communication is impossible with the
default mapping.</p>
<p>DDSI does not communicate the DCPS port number in the discovery protocol; it
assumes that each domain id maps to a unique port number. While it is unusual to
change the mapping, the specification requires this to be possible, and this means
that two different DCPS domain ids can be mapped to a single DDSI domain.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="mapping-of-dcps-entities-to-ddsi-entities">
<span id="id4"></span><h3>7.1.2. Mapping of DCPS entities to DDSI entities<a class="headerlink" href="#mapping-of-dcps-entities-to-ddsi-entities" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Each DCPS domain participant in a domain is mirrored in DDSI as a DDSI
participant. These DDSI participants drive the discovery of participants, readers and
writers in DDSI <em>via</em> the discovery protocols. By default each DDSI participant has a
unique address on the network in the form of its own UDP/IP socket with a unique
port number.</p>
<p>Any data reader or data writer created by a DCPS domain participant is mirrored in
DDSI as a DDSI reader or writer. In this translation, some of the structure of the
DCPS domain is lost, because DDSI has no knowledge of DCPS Subscribers and
Publishers. Instead, each DDSI reader is the combination of the corresponding
DCPS data reader and the DCPS subscriber it belongs to; similarly, each DDSI
writer is a combination of the corresponding DCPS data writer and DCPS publisher.
This corresponds to the way the DCPS built-in topics describe the DCPS data
readers and data writers, as there are no built-in topics for describing the DCPS
subscribers and publishers either.</p>
<p>In addition to the application-created readers and writers (referred to as
<em>‘endpoints’</em>), DDSI participants have a number of DDSI built-in endpoints used for
discovery and liveliness checking/asserting. The most important ones are those
absolutely required for discovery: readers and writers for the discovery data
concerning DDSI participants, DDSI readers and DDSI writers. Some other ones
exist as well, and a DDSI implementation can leave out some of these if it has no
use for them. For example, if a participant has no writers, it doesn’t strictly need the
DDSI built-in endpoints for describing writers, nor the DDSI built-in endpoint for
learning of readers of other participants.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reliable-communication">
<span id="id5"></span><h3>7.1.3. Reliable communication<a class="headerlink" href="#reliable-communication" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><em>Best-effort</em> communication is simply a wrapper around UDP/IP: the packet(s)
containing a sample are sent to the addresses at which the readers reside. No state is
maintained on the writer. If a packet is lost, the reader will simply drop the sample
and continue with the next one.</p>
<p>When <em>reliable</em> communication is used, the writer does maintain a copy of the
sample, in case a reader detects it has lost packets and requests a retransmission.
These copies are stored in the writer history cache (or WHC) of the DDSI writer.
The DDSI writer is required to periodically send <em>Heartbeats</em> to its readers to ensure
that all readers will learn of the presence of new samples in the WHC even when
packets get lost.</p>
<p>If a reader receives a Heartbeat and detects it did not receive all samples, it requests
a retransmission by sending an <em>AckNack</em> message to the writer, in which it
simultaneously informs the writer up to what sample it has received everything, and
which ones it has not yet received. Whenever the writer indicates it requires a
response to a Heartbeat the readers will send an AckNack message even when no
samples are missing. In this case, it becomes a pure acknowledgement.</p>
<p>The combination of these behaviours in principle allows the writer to remove old
samples from its WHC when it fills up too far, and allows readers to always receive
all data. A complication exists in the case of unresponsive readers, readers that do
not respond to a Heartbeat at all, or that for some reason fail to receive some
samples despite resending it. The specification leaves the way these get treated
unspecified.</p>
<p>Note that while this Heartbeat/AckNack mechanism is very straightforward, the
specification actually allows suppressing heartbeats, merging of AckNacks and
retransmissions, <em>etc.</em>. The use of these techniques is required to allow for a
performant DDSI implementation, whilst avoiding the need for sending redundant
messages.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ddsi-specific-transient-local-behaviour">
<span id="id6"></span><h3>7.1.4. DDSI-specific transient-local behaviour<a class="headerlink" href="#ddsi-specific-transient-local-behaviour" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The above describes the essentials of the mechanism used for samples of the
<em>‘volatile’</em> durability kind, but the DCPS specification also provides
<em>‘transient-local’</em>, <em>‘transient’</em> and <em>‘persistent’</em> data. Of these, the
DDSI specification currently only covers <em>transient-local</em>, and this is
the only form of durable data available when interoperating across vendors.</p>
<p>In DDSI, transient-local data is implemented using the WHC that is normally used
for reliable communication. For transient-local data, samples are retained even
when all readers have acknowledged them. With the default history setting of
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">KEEP_LAST</span></tt> with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">history_depth</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">1</span></tt>, this means that late-joining readers
can still obtain the latest sample for each existing instance.</p>
<p>Naturally, once the DCPS writer is deleted (or disappears for whatever reason), the
DDSI writer disappears as well, and with it, its history. For this reason, transient
data is generally much to be preferred over transient-local data. In OpenSplice the
durability service implements all three durability kinds without requiring any
special support from the networking services, ensuring that the full set of
durability features is always available between OpenSplice nodes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="discovery-of-participants-endpoints">
<span id="id7"></span><h3>7.1.5. Discovery of participants &amp; endpoints<a class="headerlink" href="#discovery-of-participants-endpoints" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>DDSI participants discover each other by means of the <em>‘Simple Participant
Discovery Protocol’</em>, or <em>‘SPDP</em>’ for short. This protocol is based on periodically
sending a message containing the specifics of the participant to a set of known
addresses. By default, this is a standardised multicast address (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">239.255.0.1</span></tt>;
the port number is derived from the domain id) that all DDSI implementations
listen to.</p>
<p>Particularly important in the SPDP message are the unicast and multicast addresses
at which the participant can be reached. Typically, each participant has a unique
unicast address, which in practice means all participants on a node all have a
different UDP/IP port number in their unicast address. In a multicast-capable
network, it doesn’t matter what the actual address (including port number) is,
because all participants will learn them through these SPDP messages.</p>
<p>The protocol does allow for unicast-based discovery, which requires listing the
addresses of machines where participants may be located, and ensuring each
participant uses one of a small set of port numbers. Because of this, some of the port
numbers are derived not only from the domain id, but also from a <em>‘participant
index’</em>, which is a small non-negative integer, unique to a participant within a node.
(The DDSI2 service adds an indirection and uses at most one participant index
regardless of how many DCPS participants it handles.)</p>
<p>Once two participants have discovered each other, and both have matched the DDSI
built-in endpoints their peer is advertising in the SPDP message, the <em>‘Simple
Endpoint Discovery Protocol’</em> or <em>‘SEDP’</em> takes over, exchanging information on the
DCPS data readers and data writers in the two participants.</p>
<p>The SEDP data is handled as reliable, transient-local data. Therefore, the SEDP
writers send Heartbeats, the SEDP readers detect they have not yet received all
samples and send AckNacks requesting retransmissions, the writer responds to these
and eventually receives a pure acknowledgement informing it that the reader has
now received the complete set.</p>

<div>Note that the discovery process necessarily creates a burst of traffic each time
a participant is added to the system: <em>all</em> existing participants respond to the
SPDP message, following which all start exchanging SEDP data.</div></blockquote>

<span id="id9"></span><h3>7.2.1. Translating between OpenSplice and DDSI<a class="headerlink" href="#translating-between-opensplice-and-ddsi" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Given that DDSI is the DDS interoperability specification, that the mapping
between DCPS entities and DDSI entities is straightforward, and that OpenSplice is
a full implementation of the DDS specification, one might expect that relationship
between OpenSplice and its DDSI implementation, DDSI2, is trivial. Unfortunately,
this is not the case, and it does show in a number of areas. A high-level overview
such as this paragraph is not the place for the details of these cases, but they
will be described in due course.</p>
<p>The root cause of these complexities is a difference in design philosophy between
OpenSplice and the more recent DDSI.</p>
<p>DDSI is very strictly a <em>peer-to-peer</em> protocol at the level of individual endpoints,
requiring lots of discovery traffic, and (at least when implemented naively) very bad
scalability. It is exactly these three problems that OpenSplice was designed to avoid,
and it does so successfully with its native <em>RTNetworking</em> service.</p>
<p>Because of this design for scalability and the consequent use of service processes
rather than forcing everything into self-contained application processes, there are
various ways in which DDSI2 has to translate between the two worlds. For example,
queuing and buffering and, consequently, blocking behaviour are subtly different;
DDSI2 needs to also perform local discovery of DCPS endpoints to gather enough
information for faithfully representing the system in terms of DDSI, it needs to
translate between completely different namespaces (native OpenSplice identifiers
are very different from the GUIDs used by DDSI), and it needs to work around
receiving asynchronous notifications for events one would expect to be synchronous
in DDSI.</p>
<p>This <em>Guide</em> aims to not only provide guidance in configuring DDSI2, but also help
in understanding the trade-offs involved.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="federated-versus-standalone-deployment">
<span id="id10"></span><h3>7.2.2. Federated versus Standalone deployment<a class="headerlink" href="#federated-versus-standalone-deployment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As has been described elsewhere (see the <a class="reference internal" href="overview.html#overview"><em>Overview</em></a> in this
<em>Guide</em> and also the <em>Getting Started Guide</em>), OpenSplice has multiple
deployment models selectable in the configuration file (some of these require
a license).</p>
<p>For DDSI2, there is no difference between the various models: it simply serves
whatever DCPS participants are in the same ‘instance’, whether that instance be a
federation of processes on a single node, all attached to a shared memory segment
managed by a set of OpenSplice service processes on that node, or a standalone one
in which a single process incorporates the OpenSplice services as libraries.</p>
<p>This <em>Guide</em> ignores the various deployment modes, using the terminology
associated with the federated deployment mode because that mode is the driving
force behind several of the user-visible design decisions in DDSI2. In consequence,
for a standalone deployment, the term <em>‘node’</em> as used in this <em>Guide</em> refers
to a single process.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="discovery-behaviour">
<span id="id11"></span><h3>7.2.3. Discovery behaviour<a class="headerlink" href="#discovery-behaviour" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<div class="section" id="local-discovery-and-built-in-topics">
<span id="id12"></span><h4>7.2.3.1. Local discovery and built-in topics<a class="headerlink" href="#local-discovery-and-built-in-topics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Inside one node, DDSI2 monitors the creation and deletion of local DCPS domain
participants, data readers and data writers. It relies on the DCPS built-in topics to
keep track of these events, and hence the use of DDSI requires that these topics are
enabled in the configuration, which is the default (see the description of
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">//OpenSplice/Domain/BuiltinTopics[&#64;enabled]</span></tt>
in the <a class="reference internal" href="guide.html#configuration"><em>Configuration</em></a> section).</p>
<p>If the built-in topics must be disabled to reduce network load, then the alternative
is to instruct DDSI2 to completely ignore them using the DCPS topic/partition to
network partition mapping available in the enhanced version, DDSI2E.</p>
<p>A separate issue is that of the DCPS built-in topics when interoperating with other
implementations. In OpenSplice the built-in topics are first-class topics, <em>i.e.</em> the
only difference between application topics and the built-in topics in OpenSplice is
that the built-in topics are pre-defined and that they are published and used by the
OpenSplice services. This in turn allows the RTNetworking service to avoid
discovery of individual domain participants and endpoints, enabling its excellent
scalability.</p>
<p>Conversely, DDSI defines a different and slightly extended representation for the
information in the built-in topics as part of the discovery protocol specification, with
a clear intent to locally reconstruct the samples of the built-in topics. Unfortunately,
this also means that the DCPS built-in topics become a special case.</p>
<p>Taken together, DDSI2 is in the unfortunate situation of having to straddle two very
different approaches. While local reconstruction of the DCPS built-in topics by
DDSI2 is clearly possible, it would negatively impact the handling of transient data.
Since handling transient data is one of the true strengths of OpenSplice, DDSI2
currently does not perform this reconstruction, with the unfortunate implication that
loss of liveliness will not be handled fully when interoperating with another DDSI
implementation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="proxy-participants-and-endpoints">
<span id="id13"></span><h4>7.2.3.2. Proxy participants and endpoints<a class="headerlink" href="#proxy-participants-and-endpoints" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>DDSI2 is what the DDSI specification calls a <em>‘stateful’</em> implementation. Writers
only send data to discovered readers and readers only accept data from discovered
writers. (There is one exception: the writer may choose to multicast the data, and
anyone listening will be able to receive it, if a reader has already discovered the
writer but not <em>vice-versa</em>; it may accept the data even though the connection is not
fully established yet.) Consequently, for each remote participant and reader or
writer, DDSI2 internally creates a proxy participant, proxy reader or proxy writer.
In the discovery process, writers are matched with proxy readers, and readers are
matched with proxy writers, based on the topic and type names and the QoS
settings.</p>
<p>Proxies have the same natural hierarchy that ‘normal’ DDSI entities have: each
proxy endpoint is owned by some proxy participant, and once the proxy participant
is deleted, all of its proxy endpoints are deleted as well. Participants assert their
liveliness periodically, and when nothing has been heard from a participant for the
lease duration published by that participant in its SPDP message, the lease becomes
expired triggering a clean-up.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, deleting endpoints simply triggers disposes and
unregisters in SEDP protocol, and, similarly, deleting a participant also creates
special messages that allow the peers to immediately reclaim resources instead of
waiting for the lease to expire.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sharing-of-discovery-information">
<span id="id14"></span><h4>7.2.3.3. Sharing of discovery information<a class="headerlink" href="#sharing-of-discovery-information" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>DDSI2 is designed to service any number of participants, as one would expect for a
service capable of being deployed in a federated system. This obviously means it is
aware of all participants, readers and writers on a node. It also means that the
discovery protocol as sketched earlier is rather wasteful: there is no need for each
individual participant serviced by DDSI2 to run the full discovery protocol for itself.</p>
<p>Instead of implementing the protocol as suggested by the standard, DDSI2 shares all
discovery activities amongst the participants, allowing one to add participants on a
node with only a minimal impact on the system. It is even possible to have only a
single DDSI participant on each node, which then becomes the virtual owner of all
the endpoints serviced by that instance of DDSI2. (See
<a class="reference internal" href="#combining-multiple-participants">Combining multiple participants</a>  and refer to the  <a class="reference internal" href="guide.html#configuration"><em>Configuration</em></a>
section for a detailed description of
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">//OpenSplice/DDSI2Service/Internal/SquashParticipants</span></tt>.) In this latter mode,
there is no discovery penalty at all for having many participants, but evidently,
any participant-based liveliness monitoring will be affected.</p>
<p>Because other implementations of the DDSI specification may be written on the
assumption that all participants perform their own discovery, it is possible to
simulate that with DDSI2. It will not actually perform the discovery for each
participant independently, but it will generate the network traffic <em>as if</em> it does.</p>
<p>Please refer to the  <a class="reference internal" href="guide.html#configuration"><em>Configuration</em></a> section for detailed descriptions of:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">//OOpenSplice/DDSI2Service/Internal/BuiltinEndpointSet</span></tt></li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">//OpenSplice/DDSI2Service/Internal/ConservativeBuiltinReaderStartup</span></tt></li>
</ul>
<p>However, please note that at the time of writing, we are not aware of any
DDSI implementation requiring the use of these settings.)</p>
<p>By sharing the discovery information across all participants in a single node, each
new participant or endpoint is immediately aware of the existing peers and will
immediately try to communicate with these peers. This may generate some
redundant network traffic if these peers take a significant amount of time for
discovering this new participant or endpoint.</p>
<p>Another advantage (particularly in a federated deployment) is that the amount of
memory required for discovery and the state of the remote entities is independent of
the number of participants that exist locally.</p>

<div class="section" id="lingering-writers">
<span id="id15"></span><h4>7.2.3.4. Lingering writers<a class="headerlink" href="#lingering-writers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>When an application deletes a reliable DCPS data writer, there is no guarantee that
all its readers have already acknowledged the correct receipt of all samples. In such
a case, DDSI2 lets the writer (and the owning participant if necessary) linger in the
system for some time, controlled by the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Internal/WriterLingerDuration</span></tt> option.
The writer is deleted when all samples have been acknowledged by all readers or
the linger duration has elapsed, whichever comes first.</p>
<p>The writer linger duration setting is currently not applied when DDSI2 is requested
to terminate. In a federated deployment it is unlikely to visibly affect system
behaviour, but in a standalone deployment data written just before terminating the
application may be lost.</p>
<p>Please refer to the  <a class="reference internal" href="guide.html#configuration"><em>Configuration</em></a> section for
a detailed description of:</p>

<div class="section" id="start-up-mode">
<span id="id16"></span><h4>7.2.3.5. Start-up mode<a class="headerlink" href="#start-up-mode" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>A similar issue exists when starting DDSI2: DDSI discovery takes time, and when
data is written immediately after DDSI2 has started, it is likely that the discovery
process hasn’t completed yet and some remote readers have not yet been
discovered. This would cause the writers to throw away samples for lack of interest,
even though matching readers already existed at the time of starting. For best-effort
writers, this is perhaps surprising but still acceptable; for reliable writers, however,
it would be very counter-intuitive.</p>
<p>Hence the existence of the so-called <em>‘start-up mode’</em>, during which all volatile
reliable writers are treated as-if they are transient-local writers. Transient-local data
is meant to ensure samples are available to late-joining readers, the start-up mode
uses this same mechanism to ensure late-discovered readers will also receive the
data. This treatment of volatile data as-if it were transient-local happens entirely
within DDSI2 and is invisible to the outside world, other than the availability of
some samples that would not otherwise be available.</p>
<p>Once DDSI2 has completed its initial discovery, it has built up its view of the
network and can locally match new writers against already existing readers, and
consequently keeps any new samples published in a writer history cache because
these existing readers have not acknowledged them yet. Hence why this mode is tied
to the start-up of the DDSI2 service, rather than to that of an individual writer.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it is impossible to detect with certainty when the initial discovery
process has been completed and therefore the time DDSI2 remains in this start-up
mode is controlled by an option: General/StartupModeDuration.</p>
<p>While in general this start-up mode is beneficial, it is not always so. There are two
downsides: the first is that during the start-up period, the writer history caches can
grow significantly larger than one would normally expect; the second is that it does
mean large amounts of historical data may be transferred to readers discovered
relatively late in the process.</p>
<p>In a federated deployment on a local-area network, the likelihood of this behaviour
causing problems is negligible, as in such a configuration the DDSI2 service
typically starts seconds before the applications and besides the discovery times are
short. The other extreme is a single-process deployment in a wide-area network,
where the application starts immediately and discovery times may be long.</p>

<p>The DDSI specification heavily relies on the notion of a writer history cache (WHC)
within which a sequence number uniquely identifies each sample. The original
OpenSplice design has a different division of responsibilities between various
components than what is assumed by the DDSI specification and this includes the
WHC. Despite the different division, the resulting behaviour is the same.</p>
<p>DDSI2 bridges this divide by constructing its own WHC when needed. This WHC
integrates two different indices on the samples published by a writer: one is on
sequence number, which is used for retransmitting lost samples, and one is on key
value and is used for retaining the current state of each instance in the WHC.</p>
<p>The index on key value allows dropping samples from the index on sequence
number when the state of an instance is overwritten by a new sample. For
transient-local, it conversely (also) allows retaining the current state of each
instance even when all readers have acknowledged a sample.</p>
<p>The index on sequence number is required for retransmitting old data, and is
therefore needed for all reliable writers. The index on key values is always needed
for transient-local data, and can optionally be used for other writers using a history
setting of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">KEEP_LAST</span></tt> with depth <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">1</span></tt>. (The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Internal/AggressiveKeepLast1Whc</span></tt>
setting controls this behaviour.) The advantage of an index on key value in such
a case is that superseded samples can be dropped aggressively, instead of having
to deliver them to all readers; the disadvantage is that it is somewhat more
resource-intensive.</p>
<p>Writer throttling is based on the WHC size using a simple bang-bang controller.
Once the WHC contains <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Internal/Watermarks/WhcHigh</span></tt> bytes in
unacknowledged samples, it stalls the writer until the number of bytes in
unacknowledged samples drops below <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Internal/Watermarks/WhcLow</span></tt>.</p>
<p>While ideally only the one writer would be stalled, the interface between the
OpenSplice kernel and DDSI2 is such that other outgoing traffic may be stalled as
well. See <a class="reference internal" href="#unresponsive-readers-head-of-stream-blocking">Unresponsive readers &amp; head-of-stream blocking</a>.</p>

<p>For reliable communications, DDSI2 must retain sent samples in the WHC until
they have been acknowledged. Especially in case of a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">KEEP_ALL</span></tt> history kind, but
also in the default case when the WHC is not aggressively dropping old samples of
instances (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Internal/AggressiveKeepLast1Whc</span></tt>), a reader that fails to acknowledge
the samples timely will cause the WHC to run into resource limits.</p>
<p>The correct treatment suggested by the DDS specification is to simply take the
writer history QoS setting, apply this to the DDSI2 WHC, and block the writer up to
its ‘max_blocking_time’ QoS setting. However, the scalable architecture of
OpenSplice renders this simple approach infeasible because of the division of labour
between the application processes and the various services. Of course, even if it
were a possible approach, the problem would still not be gone entirely, as one
unresponsive (for whatever reason) reader would still be able to prevent the writer
from making progress and thus prevent the system from making progress if the
writer is a critical one.</p>
<p>Because of this, once DDSI2 hits a resource limit on a WHC, it blocks the sequence
of outgoing samples for up to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Internal/ResponsivenessTimeout</span></tt>.
If this timeout is set larger than roughly the domain expiry time
(<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">//OpenSplice/Domain/Lease/ExpiryTime</span></tt>), it may cause entire nodes to lose
liveliness. The enhanced version, DDSI2E, has the ability to use multiple queues
and can avoid this problem; please refer to <a class="reference internal" href="#channel-configuration">Channel configuration</a>.</p>
<p>Any readers that fail to acknowledge samples in time will be marked ‘unresponsive’
and be treated as best-effort readers until they start acknowledging data again.
Readers that are marked unresponsive by a writer may therefore observe sample
loss. The ‘sample lost’ status of the data readers can be used to detect this.</p>
<p>One particular case where this can easily occur is if a reader becomes unreachable,
for example because a network cable is unplugged. While this will eventually cause
a lease to expire, allowing the proxy reader to be removed and the writer to no
longer retain data for it, in the meantime the writer can easily run into a WHC limit.
This will then cause the writer to mark the reader as unresponsive, and the system
will continue to operate. The presence of unacknowledged data in a WHC as well as
the existence of unresponsive readers will force the publication of Heartbeats, and
so unplugging a network cable will typically induce a stream of Heartbeats from
some writers.</p>
<p>Another case where this can occur is with a very fast writer, and a reader on a slow
host, and with large buffers on both sides: then the time needed by the receiving host
to process the backlog can become longer than this responsiveness timeout, causing
the writer to mark the reader as unresponsive, in turn causing the backlog to be
dropped. This allows the reader catch up, at which point it once again acknowledges
data promptly and will be considered responsive again, causing a new backlog to
build up, and so on.</p>

<span id="id20"></span><h4>7.2.6.1. Publishing in multiple partitions<a class="headerlink" href="#publishing-in-multiple-partitions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>A variety of design choices allow OpenSplice in combination with its
RTNetworking service to be fully dynamically discovered, yet without requiring an
expensive discovery protocol. A side effect of these choices is that a DCPS writer
publishing a single sample in multiple partitions simultaneously will be translated
by the current version of DDSI2 as a writer publishing multiple identical samples in
all these partitions, but with unique sequence numbers.</p>
<p>When DDSI2 is used to communicate between OpenSplice nodes, this is not an
application-visible issue, but it is visible when interoperating with other
implementations. Fortunately, publishing in multiple partitions is rarely a wise
choice in a system design.</p>
<p>Note that this only concerns publishing in multiple partitions, subscribing in
multiple partitions works exactly as expected, and is also a far more common
system design choice.</p>

<div class="section" id="wildcard-partitions">
<span id="id21"></span><h4>7.2.6.2. Wildcard partitions<a class="headerlink" href="#wildcard-partitions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>DDSI2 fully implements publishing and subscribing using partition wildcards, but
depending on many (deployment time and application design) details, the use of
partition wildcards for publishing data can easily lead to the replication of data as
mentioned in the previous subsection (<a class="reference internal" href="#publishing-in-multiple-partitions">Publishing in multiple partitions</a>).</p>
<p>Secondly, because DDSI2 implements transient-local data internally in a different
way from the way the OpenSplice durability service does, it is strongly
recommended that the combination of transient-local data and publishing using
partition wildcards be avoided completely.</p>

<span id="id23"></span><h3>7.3.1. Networking interfaces<a class="headerlink" href="#networking-interfaces" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>DDSI2 uses a single network interface, the <em>‘preferred’</em> interface, for transmitting
its multicast packets and advertises only the address corresponding to this interface
in the DDSI discovery protocol.</p>
<p>To determine the default network interface, DDSI2 ranks the eligible interfaces by
quality, and then selects the interface with the highest quality. If multiple interfaces
are of the highest quality, it will select the first enumerated one. Eligible interfaces
are those that are up and have the right kind of address family (IPv4 or IPv6).
Priority is then determined as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>interfaces with a non-link-local address are preferred over those with
a link-local one;</li>
<li>multicast-capable is preferred, or if none is available</li>
<li>non-multicast capable but neither point-to-point, or if none is available</li>
<li>point-to-point, or if none is available</li>
<li>loopback</li>
</ul>
<p>If this procedure doesn’t select the desired interface automatically, it can be
overridden by setting <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">General/NetworkInterfaceAddress</span></tt> to either the name of the
interface, the IP address of the host on the desired interface, or the network portion
of the IP address of the host on the desired interface. An exact match on the address
is always preferred and is the only option that allows selecting the desired one when
multiple addresses are tied to a single interface.</p>
<p>Please refer to the  <a class="reference internal" href="guide.html#configuration"><em>Configuration</em></a> section for
a detailed description of:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">//OpenSplice/NetworkService/General/NetworkInterfaceAddress</span></tt></li>
</ul>
<p>The default address family is IPv4, setting General/UseIPv6 will change this to
IPv6. Currently, DDSI2 does not mix IPv4 and IPv6 addressing. Consequently, all
DDSI participants in the network must use the same addressing mode. When
interoperating, this behaviour is the same, <em>i.e.</em> it will look at either IPv4 or IPv6
addresses in the advertised address information in the SPDP and SEDP discovery
protocols.</p>
<p>IPv6 link-local addresses are considered undesirable because they need to be
published and received <em>via</em> the discovery mechanism, but there is in general no way
to determine to which interface a received link-local address is related.</p>
<p>If IPv6 is requested and the preferred interface has a non-link-local address, DDSI2
will operate in a <em>‘global addressing’</em> mode and will only consider discovered
non-link-local addresses. In this mode, one can select any set of interface for
listening to multicasts. Note that this behaviour is essentially identical to that when
using IPv4, as IPv4 does not have the formal notion of address scopes that IPv6 has.
If instead only a link-local address is available, DDSI2 will run in a <em>‘link-local
addressing’</em> mode. In this mode it will accept any address in a discovery packet,
assuming that a link-local address is valid on the preferred interface. To minimise
the risk involved in this assumption, it only allows the preferred interface for
listening to multicasts.</p>
<p>When a remote participant publishes multiple addresses in its SPDP message (or in
SEDP messages, for that matter), it will select a single address to use for
communicating with that participant. The address chosen is the first eligible one on
the same network as the locally chosen interface, else one that is on a network
corresponding to any of the other local interfaces, and finally simply the first one.
Eligibility is determined in the same way as for network interfaces.</p>
<div class="section" id="multicasting">
<span id="id24"></span><h4>7.3.1.1. Multicasting<a class="headerlink" href="#multicasting" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>DDSI2 allows configuring to what extent multicast is to be used:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>whether to use multicast for data communications,</li>
<li>whether to use multicast for participant discovery,</li>
<li>on which interfaces to listen for multicasts.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is advised to allow multicasting to be used. However, if there are restrictions on
the use of multicasting, or if the network reliability is dramatically different for
multicast than for unicast, it may be attractive to disable multicast for normal
communications. In this case, setting <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">General/AllowMulticast</span></tt> to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">false</span></tt> will
force DDSI2 to use unicast communications for everything except the periodic
distribution of the participant discovery messages.</p>
<p>If at all possible, it is strongly advised to leave multicast-based participant
discovery enabled, because that avoids having to specify a list of nodes to
contact, and it furthermore reduces the network load considerably. However,
if need be, one can disable the participant discovery from sending multicasts
by setting <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Internal/SuppressSpdpMulticast</span></tt> to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">true</span></tt>.</p>
<p>To disable incoming multicasts, or to control from which interfaces multicasts are
to be accepted, one can use the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">General/MulticastRecvInterfaceAddresses</span></tt> setting.
This allows listening on no interface, the preferred, all or a specific set
of interfaces.</p>

<span id="id26"></span><h5>7.3.1.2.1. Discovery addresses<a class="headerlink" href="#discovery-addresses" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The DDSI discovery protocols, SPDP for the domain participants and SEDP for
their endpoints, usually operate well without any explicit configuration.
Indeed, the SEDP protocol never requires any configuration.</p>
<p>DDSI2 by default uses the domain id as specified in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">//OpenSplice/Domain/Id</span></tt>
but allows overriding it for special configurations using
the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Discovery/DomainId</span></tt> setting. The domain id is the basis for all UDP/IP port
number calculations, which can be tweaked when necessary using the configuration
settings under Discovery/Ports. It is however rarely necessary to change the
standardised defaults.</p>
<p>The SPDP protocol periodically sends, for each domain participant, an SPDP
sample to a set of addresses, which by default contains just the multicast address,
which is standardised for IPv4 (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">239.255.0.1</span></tt>), but not for IPv6 (it uses
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ff02::ffff:239.255.0.1</span></tt>). The actual address can be overridden using the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Discovery/SPDPMulticastAddress</span></tt> setting, which requires a valid multicast address.</p>
<p>In addition (or as an alternative) to the multicast-based discovery, any number of
unicast addresses can be configured as addresses to be contacted by specifying peers
in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Discovery/Peers</span></tt> section. Each time an
SPDP message is sent, it is sent to all of these addresses.</p>
<p>Default behaviour of DDSI2 is to include each IP address several times in the set,
each time with a different UDP port number (corresponding to another participant
index), allowing at least several applications to be present on these hosts.</p>
<p>Obviously, configuring a number of peers in this way causes a large burst of packets
to be sent each time an SPDP message is sent out, and each local DDSI participant
causes a burst of its own. Most of the participant indices will not actually be use,
making this rather wasteful behaviour.</p>
<p>DDSI2 allows explicitly adding a port number to the IP address, formatted as
IP:PORT, to avoid this waste, but this requires manually calculating the port
number. In practice it also requires fixing the participant index using
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Discovery/ParticipantIndex</span></tt> (see the description of ‘PI’ in
<a class="reference internal" href="#controlling-port-numbers">Controlling port numbers</a>) to ensure that the configured port
number indeed corresponds to the remote DDSI2 (or other DDSI implementation),
and therefore is really practicable only in a federated deployment.</p>

<p>On reception of an SPDP packet, DDSI2 adds the addresses advertised in that SPDP
packet to this set, allowing asymmetrical discovery. In an extreme example, if SPDP
multicasting is disabled entirely, host A has the address of host B in its peer list
and host B has an empty peer list, then B will eventually discover A because of an
SPDP message sent by A, at which point it adds A’s address to its own set and starts
sending its own SPDP message to A, allowing A to discover B. This takes a bit
longer than normal multicast based discovery, though.</p>

<p>Although the SEDP protocol never requires any configuration, the network
partitioning of OpenSplice DDSI2E does interact with it: so-called ‘ignored
partitions’ can be used to instruct DDSI2 to completely ignore certain DCPS topic
and partition combinations, which will prevent DDSI2 from forwarding data for
these topic/partition combinations to and from the network.</p>
<p>While it is rarely necessary, it is worth mentioning that by overriding the domain id
used by DDSI in conjunction with ignored partitions and unique SPDP multicast
addresses allows partitioning the data and giving each partition its own instance of
DDSI2.</p>

<p>In an OpenSplice standalone deployment the various configured services, such as
spliced and DDSI2, still retain their identity by creating their own DCPS domain
participants. DDSI2 faithfully mirrors all these participants in DDSI, and it will
appear at the DDSI level as if there is a large system with many participants,
whereas in reality there are only a few application participants.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Internal/SquashParticipants</span></tt> option can be used to simulate the existence
of only one participant, the DDSI2 service itself, which owns all endpoints on
that node. This reduces the background messages because far fewer liveliness
assertions need to be sent.</p>
<p>Clearly, the liveliness monitoring features that are related to domain participants
will be affected if multiple DCPS domain participants are combined into a single
DDSI domain participant. The OpenSplice services all use a liveliness QoS setting
of AUTOMATIC, which works fine.</p>
<p>In a federated deployment, the effect of this option is to have only a single DDSI
domain participant per node. This is of course much more scalable, but in no way
resembles the actual structure of the system if there are in fact multiple application
processes running on that node.</p>
<p>However, in OpenSplice the built-in topics are not derived from the DDSI
discovery, and hence in an OpenSplice-only network the use of the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Internal/SquashParticipants</span></tt> setting will not result in any loss of information
in the DCPS API or in the OpenSplice tools such as the Tester.</p>

<p>The port numbers used by DDSI2 are determined as follows, where the first two
items are given by the DDSI specification and the third is unique to DDSI2 as a way
of serving multiple participants by a single DDSI instance:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>2 ‘well-known’ multicast ports: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">B</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">B+1</span></tt></li>
<li>2 unicast ports at which only this instance of DDSI2 is listening:
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">B+PG*PI+10</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">B+PG*PI+11</span></tt></li>
<li>1 unicast port per domain participant it serves, chosen by the kernel
from the anonymous ports, <em>i.e.</em> &gt;= 32768</li>
</ul>
<p>where:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>B</em> is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Discovery/Ports/Base</span></tt> (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">7400</span></tt>) + <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Discovery/Ports/DomainGain</span></tt>
(<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">250</span></tt>) * <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Domain/Id</span></tt></li>
<li><em>PG</em> is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Discovery/Ports/ParticipantGain</span></tt> (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">2</span></tt>)</li>
<li><em>PI</em> is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Discovery/ParticipantIndex</span></tt></li>
</ul>
<p>The default values, taken from the DDSI specification, are in parentheses. There are
actually even more parameters, here simply turned into constants as there is
absolutely no point in ever changing these values; however, they <em>are</em> configurable
and the interested reader is referred to the DDSI 2.1 specification, section 9.6.1.</p>
<p>PI is the most interesting, as it relates to having multiple instances of DDSI2 in the
same domain on a single node. In a federated deployment, this never happens
(exceptional cases excluded). Its configured value is either <em>‘auto’</em>, <em>‘none’</em> or a
non-negative integer. This setting matters:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>When it is <em>‘auto’</em> (which is the default), DDSI2 probes UDP port numbers on
start-up, starting with PI = 0, incrementing it by one each time until it finds a pair
of available port numbers, or it hits the limit. The maximum PI it will ever choose
is currently still hard-coded at 9 as a way of limiting the cost of unicast discovery.
(It is recognised that this limit can cause issues in a standalone deployment.)</li>
<li>When it is <em>‘none’</em> it simply ignores the ‘participant index’ altogether and asks the
kernel to pick two random ports (&gt;= 32768). This eliminates the limit on the
number of standalone deployments on a single machine and works just fine with
multicast discovery while complying with all other parts of the specification for
interoperability. However, it is incompatible with unicast discovery.</li>
<li>When it is a non-negative integer, it is simply the value of PI in the above
calculations. If multiple instances of DDSI2 on a single machine are needed, they
will need unique values for PI, and so for standalone deployments this particular
alternative is hardly useful.</li>
</ul>
<p>Clearly, to fully control port numbers, setting <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Discovery/ParticipantIndex</span></tt> (= PI)
to a hard-coded value is the only possibility. In a federated deployment this is an
option that has very few downsides, and generally <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">0</span></tt> will be a good choice.</p>
<p>By fixing PI, the port numbers needed for unicast discovery are fixed as well. This
allows listing peers as IP:PORT pairs, significantly reducing traffic, as explained in
the preceding subsection.</p>
<p>The other non-fixed ports that are used are the per-domain participant ports, the
third item in the list. These are used only because there exist some DDSI
implementations that assume each domain participant advertises a unique port
number as part of the discovery protocol, and hence that there is never any need for
including an explicit destination participant id when intending to address a single
domain participant by using its unicast locator. DDSI2 never makes this assumption,
instead opting to send a few bytes extra to ensure the contents of a message are all
that is needed. With other implementations, you will need to check.</p>
<p>If all DDSI implementations in the network include full addressing information in
the messages, like DDSI2, then the per-domain participant ports serve no purpose at
all. The default <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">false</span></tt> setting of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Compatibility/ManySocketsMode</span></tt> disables the
creation of these ports.</p>
<p>This setting has a few other side benefits as well, as there will generally be more
participants using the same unicast locator, improving the chances for requiring but
a single unicast even when addressing a multiple participants in a node. The obvious
case where this is beneficial is when one host has not received a multicast.</p>

<p>The data path in DDSI2 consists of a transmitting and a receiving side. The main
path in the transmit side accepts data to be transmitted from the OpenSplice kernel
<em>via</em> a network queue and administrates and formats the data for transmission over
the network.</p>
<p>The secondary path handles asynchronous events such as the periodic generation of
writer Heartbeats and the transmitting of acknowledgement messages from readers
to writers, in addition to handling the retransmission of old data on request. These
requests can originate in packet loss, but also in requests for historical data from
transient-local readers.</p>
<p>The diagram <a class="reference internal" href="#data-flow-using-two-channels">Data flow using two channels</a> gives an overview of the main data
flow and the threads in a configuration using two channels. Configuring multiple
channels is an enhanced feature that is available only in DDSI2E, but the
principle is the same in both variants.</p>

<span id="id36"></span><h4>7.4.2.1. Transmit processing<a class="headerlink" href="#transmit-processing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>DDSI2E divides the outgoing data stream into prioritised channels. These channels
are handled completely independently, effectively allowing mapping DDS transport
priorities to operating system thread priorities. Although the ability to define
multiple channels is limited to DDSI2E, DDSI2 uses the same mechanisms but is
restricted to what in DDSI2E is the default channel if none are configured explicitly.
For details on configuring channels, see <a class="reference internal" href="#channel-configuration">Channel configuration</a>.</p>
<p>Each channel has its own transmit thread, draining a queue with samples to be
transmitted from the OpenSplice kernel. The maximum size of the queue can be
configured per channel, and the default for the individual channels is configured
using the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Sizing/NetworkQueueSize</span></tt> setting. In DDSI2, this setting simply controls
the queue size, as the default channel of DDSI2E has the default queue size. A larger
queue size increases the potential latency and (shared) memory requirements, but
improves the possibilities for smoothing out traffic if the applications publish it in
bursts.</p>
<p>Once a networking service has taken a sample from the queue, it takes responsibility
for it. Consequently, if it is to be sent reliably and there are insufficient resources to
store it in the WHC, it must wait for resources to become available.
See <a class="reference internal" href="#unresponsive-readers-head-of-stream-blocking">Unresponsive readers &amp; head-of-stream blocking</a>.</p>
<p>The DDSI control messages (Heartbeat, AckNack, <em>etc.</em>) are sent by a thread
dedicated to handling timed events and asynchronous transmissions, including
retransmissions of samples on request of a reader. This thread is known as the
‘timed-event thread’ and there is at least one such thread, but each channel can have
its own one.</p>
<p>DDSI2E can also perform traffic shaping and bandwidth limiting, configurable per
channel, and with independent limits for data on the one hand and control and
retransmissions on the other hand.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="retransmit-merging">
<span id="id37"></span><h4>7.4.2.2. Retransmit merging<a class="headerlink" href="#retransmit-merging" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>A remote reader can request retransmissions whenever it receives a Heartbeat and
detects samples are missing. If a sample was lost on the network for many or all
readers, the next heartbeat is likely to trigger a ‘storm’ of retransmission requests.
Thus, the writer should attempt merging these requests into a multicast
retransmission, to avoid retransmitting the same sample over &amp; over again to many
different readers. Similarly, while readers should try to avoid requesting
retransmissions too often, in an interoperable system the writers should be robust
against it.</p>
<p>In DDSI2, upon receiving a Heartbeat that indicates samples are missing, a reader
will schedule a retransmission request to be sent after <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Internal/NackDelay</span></tt>,
or combine it with an already scheduled request if possible. Any samples received
in between receipt of the Heartbeat and the sending of the AckNack will not need
to be retransmitted.</p>
<p>Secondly, a writer attempts to combine retransmit requests in two different ways.
The first is to change messages from unicast to multicast when another retransmit
request arrives while the retransmit has not yet taken place. This is particularly
effective when bandwidth limiting causes a backlog of samples to be retransmitted.
The behaviour of the second can be configured using the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Internal/RetransmitMerging</span></tt>
setting. Based on this setting, a retransmit request for a sample is either honoured
unconditionally, or it may be suppressed (or ‘merged’) if it comes in shortly after
a multicasted retransmission of that very sample, on the assumption that the second
reader will likely receive the retransmit, too. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Internal/RetransmitMergingPeriod</span></tt>
controls the length of this time window.</p>

<span id="id38"></span><h4>7.4.2.3. Retransmit backlogs<a class="headerlink" href="#retransmit-backlogs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Another issue is that a reader can request retransmission of many samples at once.
When the writer simply queues all these samples for retransmission, it may well
result in a huge backlog of samples to be retransmitted. As a result, the ones near the
end of the queue may be delayed by so much that the reader issues another
retransmit request. DDSI2E provides bandwidth limiting, which makes the situation
even worse, as it can significantly increase the time it takes for a sample to be sent
out once it has been queued for retransmission.</p>
<p>Therefore, DDSI2 limits the number of samples queued for retransmission and
ignores (those parts of) retransmission requests that would cause the retransmit
queue to contain too many samples or take too much time to process. There are two
settings governing the size of these queues, and the limits are applied per
timed-event thread (<em>i.e.</em> the global one, and typically one for each configured
channel with limited bandwidth when using DDSI2E). The first is
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Internal/MaxQueuedRexmitMessages</span></tt>, which limits the number of retransmit
messages, the second <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Internal/MaxQueuedRexmitBytes</span></tt> which limits the number of
bytes. The latter is automatically set based on the combination
of the allowed transmit bandwidth and the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Internal/NackDelay</span></tt> setting, as an
approximation of the likely time until the next potential retransmit request
from the reader.</p>

<div class="section" id="controlling-fragmentation">
<span id="id39"></span><h4>7.4.2.4. Controlling fragmentation<a class="headerlink" href="#controlling-fragmentation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Samples in DDS can be arbitrarily large, and will not always fit within a single
datagram. DDSI has facilities to fragment samples so they can fit in UDP
datagrams, and similarly IP has facilities to fragment UDP datagrams to into
network packets. The DDSI specification states that one must not unnecessarily
fragment at the DDSI level, but DDSI2 simply provides a fully configurable
behaviour.</p>
<p>If the serialised form of a sample is at least <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Internal/FragmentSize</span></tt>,
it will be fragmented using the DDSI fragmentation. All but the last fragment
will be exactly this size; the last one may be smaller.</p>
<p>Control messages, non-fragmented samples, and sample fragments are all subject to
packing into datagrams before sending it out on the network, based on various
attributes such as the destination address, to reduce the number of network packets.
This packing allows datagram payloads of up to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Internal/MaxMessageSize</span></tt>,
overshooting this size if the set maximum is too small to contain what must be
sent as a single unit. Note that in this case, there is a real problem anyway,
and it no longer matters where the data is rejected, if it is
rejected at all. UDP/IP header sizes are not taken into account in this maximum
message size.</p>
<p>The IP layer then takes this UDP datagram, possibly fragmenting it into multiple
packets to stay within the maximum size the underlying network supports. A
trade-off to be made is that while DDSI fragments can be retransmitted individually,
the processing overhead of DDSI fragmentation is larger than that of UDP
fragmentation.</p>

<p>Receiving of data is split into multiple threads, as also depicted in the overall
DDSI2 data path diagram <a class="reference internal" href="#data-flow-using-two-channels">Data flow using two channels</a>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A single receive thread responsible for retrieving network packets and running

</ul>
<p>The receive thread is responsible for retrieving all incoming network packets,
running the protocol state machine, which involves scheduling of AckNack and
Heartbeat messages and queueing of samples that must be retransmitted, and for
defragmenting and ordering incoming samples.</p>
<p>For a specific proxy writer—the local manifestation of a remote DDSI data writer—
with a number of data readers, the organisation is as shown in
the diagram <a class="reference internal" href="#proxy-writer-with-multiple-data-readers">Proxy writer with multiple data readers</a>.</p>
<p class="centered" id="proxy-writer-with-multiple-data-readers">

<p>Fragmented data first enters the defragmentation stage, which is per proxy writer.
The number of samples that can be defragmented simultaneously is limited, for
reliable data to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Internal/DefragReliableMaxSamples</span></tt>
and for unreliable data to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Internal/DefragUnreliableMaxSamples</span></tt>.</p>
<p>Samples (defragmented if necessary) received out of sequence are buffered,
primarily per proxy writer, but, secondarily, per reader catching up on historical
(transient-local) data. The size of the first is limited to
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Internal/PrimaryReorderMaxSamples</span></tt>, the size of the second to
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Internal/SecondaryReorderMaxSamples</span></tt>.</p>
<p>In between the receive thread and the delivery threads sit queues, of which the
maximum size is controlled by the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Internal/DeliveryQueueMaxSamples</span></tt>
setting. Generally there is no need for these queues to be very large, their
primary function is to smooth out the processing when batches of samples become
available at once, for example following a retransmission.</p>
<p>When any of these receive buffers hit their size limit, DDSI2 will drop incoming
(fragments of) samples and/or buffered (fragments of) samples to ensure the receive
thread can continue to make progress. Such dropped samples will eventually be
retransmitted.</p>

<span id="id44"></span><h4>7.4.4.1. Maximum sample size<a class="headerlink" href="#maximum-sample-size" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>DDSI2 provides a setting, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Internal/MaxSampleSize</span></tt>, to control the maximum size
of samples that the service is willing to process. The size is the size of
the (CDR) serialised payload, and the limit holds both for built-in data and for
application data. The (CDR) serialised payload is never larger than the in-memory
representation of the data.</p>
<p>On the transmitting side, samples larger than <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">MaxSampleSize</span></tt> are dropped with a
warning in the OpenSplice info log. DDSI2 behaves as if the sample never existed.
The current structure of the interface between the OpenSplice kernel and the
OpenSplice networking services unfortunately prevents DDSI2 from properly
reporting this back to the application that wrote the sample, so the only guaranteed
way of detecting the dropping of the sample is by checking the info log.</p>
<p>Similarly, on the receiving side, samples large than <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">MaxSampleSize</span></tt> are dropped,
and this is done as early as possible, immediately following the reception of a
sample or fragment of one, to prevent any resources from being claimed for longer
than strictly necessary. Where the transmitting side completely ignores the sample,
on the receiving side DDSI2 pretends the sample has been correctly received and, at
the DDSI2 level, acknowledges reception to the writer when asked. This allows
communication to continue.</p>
<p>When the receiving side drops a sample, readers will get a <em>‘sample lost’</em> notification
at the next sample that does get delivered to those readers. This condition means that
again checking the info log is ultimately the only truly reliable way of determining
whether samples have been dropped or not.</p>
<p>While dropping samples (or fragments thereof) as early as possible is beneficial
from the point of view of reducing resource usage, it can make it hard to decide
whether or not dropping a particular sample has been recorded in the log already.
Under normal operational circumstances, DDSI2 will report a single event for each
sample dropped, but it may on occasion report multiple events for the same sample.</p>
<p>Finally, it is technically allowed to set <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">MaxSampleSize</span></tt> to very small sizes,
even to the point that the discovery data can’t be communicated anymore.
The dropping of the discovery data will be duly reported, but the usefulness
of such a configuration seems doubtful.</p>

<span id="id48"></span><h4>7.5.2.1. Channel configuration overview<a class="headerlink" href="#channel-configuration-overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>DDSI2E allows defining <em>channels</em>, which are independent data paths within the
DDSI service. OpenSplice chooses a channel based by matching the transport
priority QoS setting of the data writer with the threshold specified for the various
channels. Because each channel has a set of dedicated threads to perform the
processing and the thread priorities can all be configured, it is straightforward to
guarantee that samples from high-priority data writers will get precedence over
those from low-priority data throughout the service stack.</p>
<p>A second aspect to the use of channels is that the head-of-line blocking mentioned
in <a class="reference internal" href="#unresponsive-readers-head-of-stream-blocking">Unresponsive readers &amp; head-of-stream blocking</a>.
Unresponsive readers &amp; head-of-stream blocking is <em>per channel</em>, guaranteeing that a
high-priority channel will not be disrupted by an unresponsive reader of low-priority
data.</p>
<p>The channel-specific threads perform essentially all processing (serialisation, writer
history cache management, deserialisation, delivery to DCPS data readers, <em>etc.</em>), but
there still is one shared thread involved. This is the receive thread (‘recv’) that
demultiplexes incoming packets and implements the protocol state machine. The
receive thread only performs minimal work on each incoming packet, and never has
to wait for the processing of user data.</p>
<p>The existence of the receive thread is the only major difference between DDSI2E
channels and those of the OpenSplice RTNetworking service: in the RTNetworking
service, each thread is truly independent. This change is the consequence of
DDSI2E interoperating with implementations that are not aware of channels and
with DDSI2E nodes that have differently configured channels, unlike the
RTNetworking service where all nodes must use exactly the same channel
definitions.</p>
<p>When configuring multiple channels, it is recommended to set the CPU priority of
the receive thread to at least that of the threads of the highest priority channel,
to ensure the receive thread will be scheduled in promptly.</p>
<p>If no channels are defined explicitly, a single, default channel is used. In DDSI2
(rather than DDSI2E), the processing is as if only this default channel exists.</p>

<div class="section" id="transmit-side">
<span id="id49"></span><h4>7.5.2.2. Transmit side<a class="headerlink" href="#transmit-side" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>For each discovered local data writer, DDSI2E determines the channel to use. This
is the channel with the lowest threshold priority of all channels that have a threshold
priority that is higher than the writer’s transport priority. If there is no such channel,
<em>i.e.</em> the writer has a transport priority higher than the highest channel threshold, the
channel with the highest threshold is used.</p>
<p>Each channel has its own network queue into which the OpenSplice kernel writes
samples to be transmitted and that DDSI2E reads. The size of this queue can be set
for each channel independently by using <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Channels/Channel/QueueSize</span></tt>, with the
default taken from the global <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Sizing/NetworkQueueSize</span></tt>.</p>
<p>Bandwidth limiting and traffic shaping are configured per channel as well. The
following parameters are configurable:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>bandwidth limit</li>
<li>auxiliary bandwidth limit</li>
<li>IP QoS settings</li>
</ul>
<p>The traffic shaping is based on a <a href="#id50"><span class="problematic" id="id51">`</span></a>leaky bucket’ algorithm: transmit credits are added
at a constant rate, the total transmit credit is capped, and each outgoing packet
reduces the available transmit credit. Outgoing packets must wait until enough
transmit credits are available.</p>
<p>Each channel has two separate credits: data and auxiliary. The data credit is used
strictly for transmitting fresh data (<em>i.e.</em> directly corresponding to writes, disposes,
<em>etc.</em>) and control messages directly caused by transmitting that data. This credit is
configured using the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Channels/Channel/DataBandwidthLimit</span></tt> setting. By default, a
channel is treated as if it has infinite data credit, disabling traffic shaping.</p>
<p>The auxiliary credit is used for everything else: asynchronous control data &amp;
retransmissions, and is configured using the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Channels/Channel/AuxiliaryBandwidthLimit</span></tt> setting.</p>
<p>When an auxiliary bandwidth limit has been set explicitly, or when one explicitly
sets, <em>e.g.</em> a thread priority for a thread named ‘tev.channel-name’, an independent
event thread handles the generation of auxiliary data for that channel. But if neither
is given, the global event thread instead handles all auxiliary data for the channel.</p>
<p>The global event thread has an auxiliary credit of its own, configured using
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Internal/AuxiliaryBandwidthLimit</span></tt>. This credit applies to all discovery-related
traffic, as well as to all auxiliary data generated by channels without their own
event thread.</p>
<p>Generally, it is best to simply specify both the data and the auxiliary bandwidth for
each channel separately, and set <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Internal/AuxiliaryBandwidthLimit</span></tt>
to limit the network bandwidth the discovery &amp; liveliness protocols can consume.</p>

<p>The delivery queue is emptied by the delivery thread, ‘dq.channel-name’, which

application data from all discovery data. One way of creating such a thread is by
setting properties for it (see <a class="reference internal" href="#thread-configuration">Thread configuration</a>),
another is by setting a bandwidth limit on the auxiliary data of the channel
(see <a class="reference internal" href="#transmit-side">Transmit side</a>).</p>

<p>Network partitions introduce alternative multicast addresses for data. In the DDSI
discovery protocol, a reader can override the default address at which it is reachable,
and this feature of the discovery protocol is used to advertise alternative multicast
addresses. The DDSI writers in the network will (also) multicast to such an
alternative multicast address when multicasting samples or control data.</p>
<p>The mapping of a DCPS data reader to a network partition is indirect: DDSI2E first
matches the DCPS data reader partitions and topic against a table of <em>‘partition
mappings’</em>, partition/topic combinations to obtain the name of a network partition,
then looks up the network partition. This makes it easier to map many different
partition/topic combinations to the same multicast address without having to specify
the actual multicast address many times over.</p>
<p>If no match is found, DDSI2E automatically defaults to standardised DDSI
multicast address.</p>

<p>Matching of a DCPS partition/topic combination proceeds in the order in which the
partition mappings are specified in the configuration. The first matching mapping is
the one that will be used. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">*</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">?</span></tt> wildcards are available for
the DCPS partition/topic combination in the partition mapping.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier (see <a class="reference internal" href="#local-discovery-and-built-in-topics">Local discovery and built-in topics</a>),
DDSI2E can be instructed to ignore all DCPS data readers and writers for
certain DCPS partition/topic combinations through the use of <em>‘IgnoredPartitions’</em>.
The ignored partitions use the same matching rules as normal mappings, and take
precedence over the normal mappings.</p>

<p>A single DCPS data reader can be associated with a set of partitions, and each

this case, DDSI2E will use the first matching network partition. This does not affect
what data the reader will receive; it only affects the addressing on the network.</p>

<p>DDSI2E encryption support allows the definition of <em>‘security profiles’</em>, named
combinations of (symmetrical block) ciphers and keys. These can be associated with
subsets of the DCPS data writers via the network partitions: data from a DCPS data
writer matching a particular network partition will be encrypted if that network
partition has an associated security profile.</p>
<p>The encrypted data will be tagged with a unique identifier for the network partition,
in cleartext. The receiving nodes use this identifier to lookup the network partition
&amp; the associated encryption key and cipher.</p>
<p>Clearly, this requires that the definition of the encrypted network partitions must be
identical on the transmitting and the receiving sides. If the network partition cannot
be found, or if the associated key or cipher differs, the receiver will ignore the
encrypted data. It is therefore not necessary to share keys with nodes that have no
need for the encrypted data.</p>
<p>The encryption is performed <em>per-packet</em>; there is no chaining from one packet to
the next.</p>

<p>DDSI2 creates a number of threads and each of these threads has a number of
properties that can be controlled individually. The threads involved in the data path
are shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#data-flow-using-two-channels"><em>the diagram</em></a> in
<a class="reference internal" href="#data-path-architecture"><em>Data path architecture</em></a>.
The properties that can be controlled are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>stack size,</li>
<li>scheduling class, and</li>
<li>scheduling priority.</li>
</ul>
<p>The threads are named and the attribute <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Threads/Thread[&#64;name]</span></tt>
is used to set the properties by thread name. Any subset of threads can be
given special properties; anything not specified explicitly is left at the
default value.</p>

in the  <a class="reference internal" href="guide.html#configuration"><em>Configuration</em></a> section)</p>
<p>The following threads exist:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>gc</em>:
garbage collector, which sleeps until garbage collection is requested for an
entity, at which point it starts monitoring the state of DDSI2, pushing the
entity through whatever state transitions are needed once it is safe to do
so, ending with the freeing of the memory.</li>
<li><em>main</em>:
the main thread of DDSI2, which performs start-up and teardown and
monitors the creation and deletion of entities in the local node using
the built-in topics.</li>
<li><em>recv</em>:
accepts incoming network packets from all sockets/ports, performs all
protocol processing, queues (nearly) all protocol messages sent in response
for handling by the timed-event thread, queues for delivery or, in special
cases, delivers it directly to the data readers.</li>
<li><em>dq.builtins</em>:
processes all discovery data coming in from the network.</li>
<li><em>lease</em>:
performs internal liveliness monitoring of DDSI2 and renews the
OpenSplice kernel lease if the status is satisfactory.</li>
<li><em>tev</em>:
timed-event handling, used for all kinds of things, such as: periodic
transmission of participant discovery and liveliness messages, transmission
of control messages for reliable writers and readers (except those that have
their own timed-event thread), retransmitting of reliable data on request
(except those that have their own timed-event thread), and handling of
start-up mode to normal mode transition.</li>
</ul>
<p>and, for each defined channel:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>xmit.channel-name</em>:
takes data from the OpenSplice kernel’s queue for this channel, serialises
it and forwards it to the network.</li>
<li><em>dq.channel-name</em>:
deserialisation and asynchronous delivery of all user data.</li>
<li><em>tev.channel-name</em>:
channel-specific ‘timed-event’ handling: transmission of control messages
for reliable writers and readers and retransmission of data on request.
Channel-specific threads exist only if the configuration includes an

<div class="section" id="reporting-and-tracing">
<span id="id66"></span><h2>7.7. Reporting and tracing<a class="headerlink" href="#reporting-and-tracing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>DDSI2 can produce highly detailed traces of all traffic and internal activities.
It enables individual categories of information, as well as having a simple
verbosity level that enables fixed sets of categories and of which the definition
corresponds to that of the other OpenSplice services.</p>
<p>The categorisation of tracing output is incomplete and hence most of the verbosity
levels and categories are not of much use in the current release. This is an ongoing
process and here we describe the target situation rather than the current situation.</p>
<p>All <em>‘fatal’</em> and <em>‘error’</em> messages are written both to the DDSI2 log and to the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ospl-error.log</span></tt> file; similarly all ‘warning’ messages are written to the DDSI2
log and the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ospl-info.log</span></tt> file.</p>
<p>The Tracing element has the following sub elements:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>Verbosity</em>:
selects a tracing level by enabled a pre-defined set of categories. The
list below gives the known tracing levels, and the categories they enable:<ul>
<li><em>none</em></li>
<li><em>severe</em>: ‘error’ and ‘fatal’</li>
<li><em>warning</em>, <em>info</em>: severe + ‘warning’</li>
<li><em>config</em>: info + ‘config’</li>
<li><em>fine</em>: config + ‘discovery’</li>
<li><em>finer</em>: fine + ‘traffic’, ‘timing’ and ‘info’</li>
<li><em>finest</em>: fine + ‘trace’</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>EnableCategory</em>:
a comma-separated list of keywords, each keyword enabling
individual categories. The following keywords are recognised:<ul>
<li><em>fatal</em>: all fatal errors, errors causing immediate termination</li>
<li><em>error</em>: failures probably impacting correctness but not necessarily causing
immediate termination.</li>
<li><em>warning</em>: abnormal situations that will likely not impact correctness.</li>
<li><em>config</em>: full dump of the configuration</li>
<li><em>info</em>: general informational notices</li>
<li><em>discovery</em>: all discovery activity</li>
<li><em>data</em>: include data content of samples in traces</li>
<li><em>radmin</em>: receive buffer administration</li>
<li><em>timing</em>: periodic reporting of CPU loads per thread</li>
<li><em>traffic</em>: periodic reporting of total outgoing data</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the keyword <em>trace</em> enables all but <em>radmin</em>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>OutputFile</em>:
the file to write the DDSI2 log to</li>
<li><em>AppendToFile</em>:
boolean, set to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">true</span></tt> to append to the log instead of replacing
the file.</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, the useful verbosity settings are <em>config</em> and <em>finest</em>.</p>
<p><em>Config</em> writes the full configuration to the DDSI2 log file as well as
any warnings or errors, which can be a good way to verify everything is
configured and behaving as expected.</p>
<p><em>Finest</em> provides a detailed trace of everything that occurs and is an
indispensable source of information when analysing problems; however,
it also requires a significant amount of time and results in huge log files.</p>
<p>Whether these logging levels are set using the verbosity level or by enabling
the corresponding categories is immaterial.</p>

<div class="section" id="conformance-modes">
<span id="id68"></span><h3>7.8.1. Conformance modes<a class="headerlink" href="#conformance-modes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The DDSI2 service operates in one of three modes: <em>pedantic</em>, <em>strict</em> and <em>lax</em>;
the mode is configured using the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Compatibility/StandardsConformance</span></tt> setting.
The default is <em>lax</em>.</p>
<p>(Please refer to the  <a class="reference internal" href="guide.html#configuration"><em>Configuration</em></a> section for
a detailed description of
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">//OpenSplice/DDSI2Service/Compatibility/StandardsConformance</span></tt>.)</p>
<p>In <em>pedantic</em> mode, it strives very hard to strictly conform to the DDSI 2.1
standard. It even uses a vendor-specific extension for an essential element
missing in the specification, used for specifying the GUID of a DCPS data reader
or data writer in the discovery protocol; and it adheres to the specified
encoding of the reliability QoS. This mode is of interest for compliancy
testing but not for practical use, even though there is no application-level
observable difference between an all-OpenSplice system using the DDSI2
service in pedantic mode and one operating in any of the other modes.</p>
<p>The second mode, <em>strict</em>, instead attempts to follow the <em>intent</em> of the
specification while staying close to the letter of it. The points in which
it deviates from the standard are in all probability editing errors that
will be rectified in the next update. When operated in this mode, one
would expect it to be fully interoperable with other vendors’ implementations,
but this is not the case. The deviations in other vendors’ implementations
are not required to implement DDSI 2.1, as is proven by the OpenSplice DDSI2
service, and they cannot rightly be considered ‘true’ implementations of
the DDSI 2.1 standard.</p>
<p>The default mode, <em>lax</em>, attempts to work around (most of) the deviations
of other implementations, and provides interoperability with (at least) RTI
DDS and InterCOM/Gallium DDS. (For compatibility with TwinOaks CoreDX DDS,
additional settings are needed. See
<a class="reference internal" href="#compatibility-issues-with-twinoaks"><em>the next section</em></a>
for more information.)
In lax mode, the OpenSplice DDSI2 service not only accepts some invalid
messages, but will even transmit them. The consequences for interoperability
of not doing this are simply too severe.
It should be noted that if one configures two OpenSplice nodes with DDSI2 in
different compliancy modes, the one in the stricter mode will complain about
messages sent by the one in the less strict mode. Pedantic mode will complain about
invalid encodings used in strict mode, strict mode will complain about illegal
messages transmitted by the lax mode. There is nonetheless interoperability
between strict and lax.</p>
<div class="section" id="compatibility-issues-with-rti">
<span id="id69"></span><h4>7.8.1.1. Compatibility issues with RTI<a class="headerlink" href="#compatibility-issues-with-rti" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>In <em>lax</em> mode, there should be no major issues with most topic types when working
across a network, but within a single host there is a known problem with the way
RTI DDS uses, or attempts to use, its shared memory transport to communicate with
OpenSplice, which clearly advertises only UDP/IP addresses at which it is
reachable. The result is an inability to reliably establish bidirectional
communication between the two.</p>
<p>Disposing data may also cause problems, as RTI DDS leaves out the serialised key
value and instead expects the reader to rely on an embedded hash of the key value.
In the strict modes, the DDSI2 service requires a proper key value to be supplied;
in the relaxed mode, it is willing to accept key hash, provided it is of a form that
contains the key values in an unmangled form.</p>
<p>If an RTI DDS data writer disposes an instance with a key of which the serialised
representation may be larger than 16 bytes, this problem is likely to occur. In
practice, the most likely cause is using a key as string, either unbounded, or with a
maximum length larger than 11 bytes. See the DDSI specification for details.</p>
<p>In <em>strict</em> mode, there is interoperation with RTI DDS, but at the cost of incredibly
high CPU and network load, caused by a Heartbeats and AckNacks going
back-and-forth between a reliable RTI DDS data writer and a reliable OpenSplice
DCPS data reader. The problem is that once the OpenSplice reader informs the RTI
writer that it has received all data (using a valid AckNack message), the RTI writer
immediately publishes a message listing the range of available sequence numbers
and requesting an acknowledgement, which becomes an endless loop.</p>
<p>The best settings for interoperation appear to be:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Compatibility/StandardsConformance</span></tt>: <em>lax</em></li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Compatibility/AckNackNumbitsEmptySet</span></tt>: <em>0</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the latter setting causes the DDSI2 service to generate illegal messages,
and is the default when in lax mode.</p>
