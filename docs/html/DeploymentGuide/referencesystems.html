<span id="id1"></span><h1>13. Example Reference Systems<a class="headerlink" href="#example-reference-systems" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p><em>The OpenSplice middleware can be deployed for different kinds of
systems. This section identifies several different systems that will
be used as reference systems throughout the rest of this manual. Each
needs to be configured differently in order to fit its requirements.
The intention of this section is to give the reader an impression of
the possible differences in system requirements and the configuration
aspects induced.</em></p>
<div class="section" id="zero-configuration-system">
<h2>13.1. Zero Configuration System<a class="headerlink" href="#zero-configuration-system" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The OpenSplice middleware comes with a default configuration file
that is intended to give a satisfactory out-of-the-box experience. It
suits the standard situation of a system containing a handful of
nodes with only a few applications per node (enabling standalone
‘single-process’ deployment) and where requirements on data
distribution latencies, volumes and determinism are not too demanding
(enabling use of the standard DDSI networking service).</p>
<p>Starting and running any systems that satisfy these conditions should
not be a problem. Nodes can be started and shut down without any extra
configuration because the default discovery mechanism will keep track
of the networking topology.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="single-node-system">
<h2>13.2. Single Node System<a class="headerlink" href="#single-node-system" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Systems that have to run as a federation on a single node can be
down-scaled considerably by not starting the networking and
durability daemons. The networking daemon is obviously not needed
because its responsibility is forwarding data to and from the
network, which is not present. The durability daemon is not needed
because the OpenSplice libraries themselves are capable of handling
durable data on a single node.</p>
<p>Note that this is not the case for single process deployments.
Multiple single process applications that are running on the same
machine node can only communicate when there is a networking service
running within each process. This is because there is no shared
administration between the applications, unlike for the shared memory
deployments when a networking service is not required for a single
node system.</p>
<p>With a single node system, the OpenSplice services do not have much
influence on application behaviour. The application has full control
over its own thread priorities and all OpenSplice activities will be
executed in the scope of the application threads.</p>
<p>One exception to this is the listener thread. This thread is
responsible for calling listener functions as described in the DDS
specification.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="medium-size-static-near-real-time-system">
<h2>13.3. Medium Size Static (Near) Real-time System<a class="headerlink" href="#medium-size-static-near-real-time-system" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Many medium size systems have highly demanding requirements with
respect to data distribution latencies, volumes and predictability.
Such systems require configuration and tuning at many levels. The
OpenSplice middleware will be an important player in the system and
therefore is highly configurable in order to meet these requirements.
Every section reflects on an aspect of the configuration.</p>
<div class="section" id="high-volumes">
<h3>13.3.1. High Volumes<a class="headerlink" href="#high-volumes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The OpenSplice middleware architecture is designed for efficiently
transporting many small messages. The networking service is capable
of packing messages from different writing applications into one
network packet. For this, the latency budget quality of service
should be applied. A latency budget allows the middleware to optimise
on throughput. Messages will be collected and combined during an
interval allowed by the latency budget. This concerns networking
traffic only.</p>
<p>A network channel that has to support high volumes should be
configured to do so. By default, the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Resolution</span></tt> parameter is set to
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">50</span> <span class="pre">ms</span></tt>. This means that latency budget values will be truncated to
multiples of 50 ms, which is a suitable value. For efficient packing,
the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">FragmentSize</span></tt> should be set to a large value, for example <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">8000</span></tt>.
This means that data will be sent to the network in chunks of 8
kilobytes. A good value for <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">MaxBurstSize</span></tt> depends on the speed of the
attached network and on the networking load. If several writers start
writing simultaneously at full speed during a longer period,
receiving nodes could start losing packets. Therefore, the writers
might need  to be slowed down to a suitable speed.</p>
<p>Note that message with a large latency budget might be overtaken by
messages with a smaller latency budget, especially if they are
transported <em>via</em> different networking channels.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="low-latencies">
<h3>13.3.2. Low Latencies<a class="headerlink" href="#low-latencies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If messages are to be transported with requirements on their end to
end times, a zero latency budget quality of service should be
attached. This results in an immediate wake-up of the networking
service at the moment that the message arrives in a networking queue.
For optimal results with respect to end-to-end latencies, the thread
priority of the corresponding networkChannel should be higher than
the thread priority of the writing application. with the current
implementation, a context switch between the writing application and
the networking channel is always required. With the correct
priorities, the induced latency is minimized.</p>
<p>The value of the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Resolution</span></tt> parameter has its consequences for using
latency budgets. The networking service will ignore any latency
budgets that have a value smaller than Resolution.</p>
<p>The effect of sending many messages with a zero latency budget is an
increase of CPU load. The increasing number of context switches
require extra processing. This quality of service should therefore be
consciously used.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="responsiveness">
<h3>13.3.3. Responsiveness<a class="headerlink" href="#responsiveness" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Especially with respect to reliable transport over the network,
responsiveness is an important aspect. Whenever a reliably sent
message is lost on the network, the sending node has to initiate a
resend. Since OpenSplice networking uses an acknowledgement protocol,
it is the up to the sending side to decide when to resend a message.
This behaviour can be tuned.</p>
<p>First of all, the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Resolution</span></tt> parameter is important. This parameter
gives the interval at which is checked if any messages have to be
resent. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">RecoveryFactor</span></tt> parameter indicates how many of these
checks have to be executed before actually resending a message. If
Resolution is scaled down, messages will be resent earlier. If
Recovery factor is scaled down, messages will be resent earlier as
well.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="topology-discovery">
<h3>13.3.4. Topology Discovery<a class="headerlink" href="#topology-discovery" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>OpenSplice RT-Networking Service implements a discovery protocol for
discovering other nodes in the system. As long as only one node is
present, nothing has to be sent to the network. As soon as at least
two nodes are present, networking starts sending data to the network.
The node-topology detection also allows for quick reaction to
topology changes, such as when a publishing node disappears (due to a
disconnection or a node crash); a ‘tightly-configured’ discovery
allows for swift detection of such topology changes, and related
updating of DDS-level liveliness administration.</p>
