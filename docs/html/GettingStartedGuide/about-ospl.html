<h2>2.2. Vortex OpenSplice Architecture<a class="headerlink" href="#vortex-opensplice-architecture" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="overall">
<h3>2.2.1. Overall<a class="headerlink" href="#overall" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To ensure scalability, flexibility and extensibility, Vortex OpenSplice has
an internal architecture that, when selected, uses shared memory to
`interconnect&#8217; not only all applications that reside within one
computing node, but also `hosts&#8217; a configurable and extensible set of
services. These services provide `pluggable&#8217; functionality such as
networking (providing QoS driven real-time networking based on multiple
reliable multicast `channels&#8217;), durability (providing fault tolerant
storage for both real-time `state&#8217; data as well as persistent
`settings&#8217;), and remote control &amp; monitoring `soap service&#8217; (providing
remote web based access using the SOAP protocol from the OpenSplice DDS
Tuner tools).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="scalability">
<h3>2.2.2. Scalability<a class="headerlink" href="#scalability" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Vortex OpenSplice is capable of using a shared-memory architecture where
data is physically present only once on any machine, and where smart
administration still provides each subscriber with his own private
`view&#8217; on this data. This allows a subscriber&#8217;s data cache to be
perceived as an individual `database&#8217; that can be content-filtered,
queried, etc. (using the content-subscription profile as supported by
OpenSplice DDS). This shared-memory architecture results in an extremely
small footprint, excellent scalability and optimal performance when
compared to implementations where each reader/writer are `communication
endpoints&#8217; each with its own storage (in other words, historical data
both at reader and writer) and where the data itself still has to be
moved, even within the same physical node.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="configuration">
<h3>2.2.3. Configuration<a class="headerlink" href="#configuration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Vortex OpenSplice is highly configurable, even allowing the architectural
structure of the DDS middleware to be chosen by the user at deployment
time. Vortex OpenSplice can be configured to run using a <em>shared memory</em>
architecture, where both the DDS related administration (including the
optional pluggable services) and DDS applications interface directly
with shared memory. Alternatively, Vortex OpenSplice also supports a
<em>single process</em> library architecture, where one or more DDS
applications, together with the OpenSplice administration and services,
can all be grouped into a single operating system process. Both
deployment modes support a configurable and extensible set of services,
providing functionality such as:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>networking</em> - providing real-time networking options allowing for
trade-offs between `interoperability&#8217; (with other DDS vendors) and
scalability (supporting ultra-large systems).</li>
<li><em>durability</em> - providing fault-tolerant storage for both real-time state
data as well as persistent settings</li>
<li><em>remote control and monitoring SOAP service</em> - providing remote web-based
access using the SOAP protocol from the OpenSplice Tuner tool</li>
<li><em>dbms service</em> - providing a connection between the real-time and the
enterprise domain by bridging data from DDS to DBMS and <em>vice versa</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The Vortex OpenSplice middleware can be easily configured, on the fly,
using its pluggable architecture: the services that are needed can be
specified together with their optimum configuration for the particular
application domain, including networking parameters, and durability
levels for example).</p>
<p>There are advantages to both the single process and shared memory
deployment architectures, so the most appropriate deployment choice
depends on the user&#8217;s exact requirements and DDS scenario.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="single-process-library-architecture">
<h2>2.3. Single Process Library Architecture<a class="headerlink" href="#single-process-library-architecture" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This deployment allows the DDS applications and OpenSplice
administration to be contained together within one single operating
system process. This single process deployment option is most useful in
environments where shared memory is unavailable or undesirable. As
dynamic heap memory is utilized in the single process deployment
environment, there is no need to pre-configure a shared memory segment
which in some use cases is also seen as an advantage of this deployment
option.</p>
<p>Each DDS application on a processing node is implemented as an
individual, self-contained operating system process (<em>i.e.</em> all of the
DDS administration and necessary services have been linked into the
application process). This is known as a <em>single process application</em>.
Communication between multiple single process applications co-located on
the same machine node is done via the (loop-back) network, since there
is no memory shared between them.</p>
<p>An extension to the single process architecture is the option to
co-locate multiple DDS applications into a single process. This can be
done be creating application libraries rather than application
executables that can be `linked&#8217; into the single process in a similar
way to how the DDS middleware services are linked into the single
process. This is known as a <em>single process application cluster</em>.
Communication between clustered applications (that together form a
single process) can still benefit from using the process&#8217;s heap memory,
which typically is an order of magnitude faster than using a network,
yet the lifecycle of these clustered applications will be tightly
coupled.</p>
<p>The Single Process deployment is the default architecture provided
within Vortex OpenSplice and allows for easy deployment with minimal
configuration required for a running DDS system.</p>

<div class="section" id="shared-memory-architecture">
<h2>2.4. Shared Memory architecture<a class="headerlink" href="#shared-memory-architecture" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the shared memory architecture data is physically present only once
on any machine but smart administration still provides each subscriber
with his own private view on this data. Both the DDS applications and
OpenSplice administration interface directly with the shared memory
which is created by the OpenSplice daemon on start up. This architecture
enables a subscriber&#8217;s data cache to be seen as an individual database
and the content can be filtered, queried, etc. by using the OpenSplice
content subscription profile.</p>
<p>Typically for advanced DDS users, the shared memory architecture is a
more powerful mode of operation and results in extremely low footprint,
excellent scalability and optimal performance when compared to the
implementation where each reader/writer are communication end points
each with its own storage (<em>i.e.</em> historical data both at reader and
writer) and where the data itself still has to be moved, even within the
same platform.</p>
