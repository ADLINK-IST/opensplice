The Vortex OpenSplice environment must be set correctly for UNIX-based platforms
before the Vortex OpenSplice IDL Pre-processor can be used. 

Run ``release.com`` from a shell command line to set the environment. 

``release.com`` is located in the root directory of the Vortex OpenSplice 
installation (``<OSPL_HOME>``):

::
   
   % . <OSPL_HOME>/release.com


The Vortex OpenSplice IDL Pre-processor, ``idlpp``, can be invoked by 
running it from a command shell:

::
   
   % idlpp


The ``idlpp`` command line options are fully described in 
:ref:`IDL Pre-processor Command Line Options <Command Line Options>`.
