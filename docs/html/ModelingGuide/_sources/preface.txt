About The Modeling Guide
************************

The *Modeling Guide* is included with the Vortex OpenSplice Modeler 
documentation set.

The *Modeling Guide* is intended to be used with the Vortex OpenSplice 
Modeler product suite.


Intended Audience
*****************

The *Modeling Guide* is intended to be used by Vortex OpenSplice Modeler users.


Organisation
************

The *Guide* is organised as follows:

The :ref:`Introduction <Introduction>` explains what the Vortex OpenSplice 
Modeler is, what its advantages and benefits are, and provides general 
information about the Modeler product.

The :ref:`Installation <Installation>` section provides the instructions for 
installing Vortex OpenSplice Modeler.

The :ref:`features and tools <Modeler Described>` of Vortex 
OpenSplice Modeler are then described in detail, and
an outline of their use for modeling and code generation
is given.

The :ref:`Modeling <Modeling>` section describes in 
detail how to use the tools in Vortex OpenSplice Modeler 
for modeling and assembling resources.

The next section, on :ref:`Code Generation <Code Generation>`,
describes how to use the Vortex OpenSplice 
Modeler for generating DDS-compliant source code. 

:ref:`Launch Configurations <Creating Launch Configurations>`,
convenient ways to run and control the Modeler, are
described next.

The following section gives details of how to 
:ref:`compile and run applications <Compiling and Running>`
using Vortex OpenSplice Modeler and Eclipse Workbench. 

There is also a :ref:`Tutorial <Tutorial>`, which uses a DDS-based example 
to demonstrate how to use the basic features of the Vortex OpenSplice 
Modeler modeling tool.

Finaly, two Appendices contain source code in :ref:`Java <Appendix A>` 
and :ref:`C++ <Appendix B>` for the Chatroom example project described 
in the :ref:`Tutorial <Tutorial>`.
