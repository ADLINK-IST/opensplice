The Python DCPS API provides users with Python classes to model DDS communication using Python and pure DDS applications.

The Python DCPS API is a native Python binding that supports full DDS functionality.  The language binding consists of a Python interface and a C wrapper implementation of the C99 API (C API for DDS). It makes use of Python language features and leverages ease of use by providing a higher level of abstraction.

**What is DDS?**

“The Data Distribution Service (DDS™) is a middleware protocol and API standard for data-centric connectivity from the Object Management Group® (OMG®). It integrates the components of a system together, providing low-latency data connectivity, extreme reliability, and a scalable architecture that business and mission-critical Internet of Things (IoT) applications need.”

“The main goal of DDS is to share the right data at the right place at the right time, even between time-decoupled publishers and consumers. DDS implements global data space by carefully replicating relevant portions of the logically shared dataspace.”  DDS specification
