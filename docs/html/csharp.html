    <h2><a name="usage">How to use the C# API</a></h2>
    <p>
      The API is currently compiled on the Windows platform using Microsoft's C# compiler. 
      A port to Linux using the Mono framework has also been used by the opensource community,
      but that is not yet part of the commercially supported releases. However, it should be possible to run the
      Windows DLL on Mono, since Mono is binary compatible with Windows. The resulting 
      deliverable is a library file called dcpssacs.dll, which you can find in the lib 
      directory alongside all the other OpenSplice DDS product libraries. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the DLL is a managed assembly, it is not found by Windows using the normal
      PATH variable. In order for the .NET framework to find a library, this library 
      must either be copied to the same location as the executable that tries to load it
      (in other words, each executable needs to have a copy of the library in its own 
      directory), or the library must be copied into the Global Assembly Cache (GAC). 
      This is now done when installing OpenSplice 5.2 and above.
      (For details about the global assembly cache, and how to manage it, see 
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Assembly_Cache"> the Wikipedia 
      Global Assembly Cache information</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The C# API is very similar to the other language bindings,
      with a couple of exceptions:
      <ul>
        <li>The C# API satisfies the C# coding conventions, meaning that:</li> 
        <ul>
          <li>All interfaces start with the 'I' character.</li> 
          <li>All operations are written in CamelBack notation ('CreateTopic' 
          instead of 'create_topic')</li> 
          <li>Class-Attributes are not implemented by explicit getter operations,
          but by C# properties.</li> 
        </ul>
        <li>The C# API introduces operation overloading: 
        many operations have multiple versions with different parameters:</li> 
        <ul>
          <li>Choose the operation with the minimum amount of parameters that fits your need.</li> 
          <li>Parameters that are not passed are set to their default values.</li> 
          <li>This removes the need for some of the special purpose macro's that represent 
          default values for parameters.</li> 
        </ul>
        <li>Constants have been defined in the classes they refer to.</li> 
        <ul>
          <li>For example: the DURATION_INFINITE is a constant called 'Infinite'
          in the struct Duration.</li> 
        </ul>
      </ul>    
    </p>
    <p>
      To generate a C# data model from your Topic IDL definitions, use idlpp in the
      following way:
      <ul>
        <ol>idlpp -l cs -S &lt IDL_FILE &gt</ol>
      </ul> 
      <p>
        Here, 'cs' represents the Csharp language, and -S represents the fact 
        that there is no dependency on any ORB. See also 'idlpp -h'.
      </p>
    </p>


    <h2><a name="limitations">Current limitations of the C# API</a></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>idlpp is not able to generate the correct C# representation for IDL unions.</li>
      <li>Datatypes generated by idlpp are not always initialized to valid default values.
       For example, an array of strings is initialized to a string array holding 
       'null' pointers, which you need to assign manually before you can write the 
       contents of your sample into the DDS.</li>
    </ul>
