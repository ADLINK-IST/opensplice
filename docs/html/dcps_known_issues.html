            <i>
              The internal OpenSplice DDS query parser does not support escape characters. This
              implicates that specific tokens cannot be used in query expressions (like
              for instance SQL keywords 'select', 'where', etc).<br/>
              Impact at API level:
              <ul>
                <li>Topics with a SQL keyword as name cannot be created</li>
                <li>
                  QueryCondition expressions cannot refer to datafields with SQL keyword as name
                </li>
                <li>
                  ContentFilteredTopic expressions cannot refer to datafields with SQL keyword as name
                </li>

              When a type support object is created with an type name which is not known in
              the meta database, the following register_type function crashes.

            <i>
            The following (faulty) idl code generates a 'floating point exception', instead idlpp should
            not allow such constructs.
            <pre><code>
            struct TestStruct;

            struct TestStruct{
                long x;
                TestStruct someEnum;
                string val;
            };
            </code></pre>
            The following idl also fails (the forward declaration to the TestStruct is not correctly
            processed):
            <pre><code>
            struct TestStruct;

            struct TestStruct1{
                TestStruct y;
            };

            struct TestStruct{
                long x;
            };
            </code></pre>
            with the error: <code>***DDS parse error TestStruct undefined at line: 4</code>. The
            following idl construct is not allowed, however the IDL preprocessor does not give
            a clear error:
            <pre><code>
            struct TestStruct;

            struct TestStruct1{
                TestStruct y;
            };

            struct TestStruct{
                TestStruct1 x;

            <b>Implicit unregister messages can corrupt copy-out functions</b><br/>
            <i>
              On all language bindings there are methods that only use the key
              fields of a sample, as for example the register, unregister and
              dispose methods. However, currently the complete sample (including
              the non-key fields) need to adhere to the IDL to language mapping
              rules, as all fields are validated. This means that when a sample
              contains garbage data in its non-key fields, the sample could be
              rejected and the application might even crash in case of dangling
              pointers (segmentation fault). <br>
              The work-around is that no values should be initalised to NULL
              values, no values should contain dangling pointers, all unions
              should explicitly be initialized to a valid value and any
              enumeration value should remain within its bounds.

            <i>
              ospl_projgen will generate projects which will build incorrectly if it is supplied an output
              directory ( -o option ) in which the final part of the path matches the name of one of the
              address spaces being generated. <br>
              e.g. ospl_projgen ... -t mmstat -o path/mmstat<br>
              These projects appear to build correctly however the final image will be incorrect.<br>

            <b>Sequences are not currently supported in multi-domain applications.</b><br/>
            <i>
              On Solaris9 there may be an error in the ospl-error.log when the networking service is started:
              "setsockopt returned errno 132 (No buffer space available)" this is down to the udp_max_buf being to small.
              To find out what the system has it set to do <code> /usr/sbin/ndd -get /dev/udp udp_max_buf</code> and to set it larger do :
              <code>/usr/sbin/ndd -set /dev/udp udp_max_buf &ltxxxxxxx size in bytes&gt </code>

            <b>Sequences are not currently supported in multi-domain applications.</b><br/>
            <i>
              Sequences can be used in case the application only writes them in one domain,
              and never in the other domain(s). Because of the current implementation, this
              restriction only applies on topic level, so for each topic it means that you can
              only write sequences on that topic in one single domain. Another option is that
              instead of using sequences, use arrays, with the downside that you always use the
              worst-case amount of resources.

            <b>Windows Services on Windows 7</b><br/>
            <i>
              If OpenSplice DDS is installed as a windows service but without a valid license in place
              then on Windows 7 it will just report starting and not allow a user to take any actions. To fix this,
              please reboot after installing a valid license (by default a license file is picked up
              from the OpenSplice DDS installation etc directory). This issue will be fixed in the next
              OpenSplice DDS release.
