      <h1>Contents</h1>
      <p>
        Possible problems and known errors within the OpenSplice DDS DDSI implementation.
      </p>
        <h1>Limitations</h1>
        <p>The current implementation has limited functionality, but this will be extended
        in future releases. Known limitations of the current implementation are:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Only BEST_EFFORT reliability QoS has been implemented. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Only VOLATILE durability QoS has been implemented. 
            </li>
            <li>
                QoS modifications after the creation of an entity is not possible.
            </li>
            <li>
                Only the x86.linux2.6 platform is available.
            </li>
        </ul>
         </p>
        <h1>Known interoperability issues</h1>
        <h2>Key hash</h2>
        <p>The Key Hash provides a hint for the key that uniquely identifies the 
        data-object that is being changed within the set of objects that have been 
        registered by a DDS DataWriter. Nominally the key is part of the serialized data
        of a data submessage. Using the key hash may benefit implementations by 
        providing a faster alternative than deserializing the full key from the received
        data-object. Whether this is faster depends on the way instances are stored 
        internally though. Therefore implementations must also support sending/receiving 
        serialized data besides or instead of the key hash only.</p>
            
        <p>This implementation only supports sending/receiving key hashes for keys up to 16 
        bytes. For larger keys, the implementation omits the key hash and requires 
        the serialized data within a data sub-message. This means other implementations
        must also send this serialized data and be able to handle incoming dispose and 
        unregister data submessages with serialized data (and without key hash) 
        correctly.</p>
