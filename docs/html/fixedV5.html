    This page contains a list of all bugfixes and changes incorporated in
    OpenSplice V5.x series of releases<br>
    
    <h2><a name="highlights">Release Highlights</a></h2>
    <h3>OpenSplice DDS V5.5.0 contains the following new features:</h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Support for IPV6 for native networking on Windows, Linux and Solaris.<br>
      <li>DDSI2 improvements, including fragmentation for large messages. <a href="ddsi2_release_notes.html">See the DDSI2 release notes for more information.</a><br>
      </li>
      <li>Support for the get_discovered_xxx() APIs</b><br/>
          DomainParticipant; get_discovered_participants(), get_discovered_particpant_data(),
          get_discovered_topics() and get_discovered_topic_data() for C, C++ and Java.</li>
      <li>DDSI1 is now removed from the runtime, but is available as source code. Note: This source
      will be removed when OpenSplice v6 series is released. We recommend any DDSI1 users transition to
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>OpenSplice DDS V5.4.2 contains the following new features:</h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Bounded strings as character array.<br>
         In some use cases a large number of (relatively small) strings may be used in the data
         model and because each string is a reference type, it means that it is not stored inline in
         the datamodel but instead as a pointer. This will result in separate allocations for each
         string (and thus a performance penalty when writing data) and a slight increase in
         memory usage due to pointers and (memory storage) headers for each string.
         The OpenSplice DDS IDL Pre-Processor features a special pragma called stac which
         can be utilized in such use cases. This pragma allows one to indicate that OpenSplice
         DDS should store strings internally as character arrays (but on API level are still bounded
         strings). Because a character array has a fixed size, the pragma stac only effects
         bounded strings. By storing the strings internally as a character array the number of
         allocations is reduced and less memory is used. This is most effective in a scenario
         where a typical string has a relatively small size, e.g. less then 100 characters.<br><br>
         See the IDL Pre-processor user guide for detailed information.
      </li>
      <li>Improved performance for durability using memory mapped persistence by adding multi-threading capability.
         See the reference manual for more information.</li>
     <li>Improved footprint by separation of the key value from a sample. As a
         result only the key value needs to be stored for disposes and
         registrations of an instance. This improves footprint considerably in
         case the key value is just a small part of the entire sample.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>OpenSplice DDS V5.4.1p4 contains the following new features:</h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Support for windows hosted VxWorks 6.8 PENTIUM4.
      </li>
      <li>Support for windows hosted VxWorks 6.7.1 SIMPENTIUM.
      </li>
      <li>Support for windows and linux hosted VxWorks 6.5 PPC32.
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>OpenSplice DDS V5.4.1p1 contains the following new features:</h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Support for linux hosted VxWorks 6.5 PPC604.
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>OpenSplice DDS V5.4.1 contains the following new features:</h3>
    <p>
       <ul>
          <li>A brand new beta implementation of DDSI, known now as DDSI2 is now released.
          In this release the old DDSI is still available, but is now deprecated and
          will be removed in the next major/minor release.
          For more information on what DDSI2 supports then see the
          <a href="ddsi2_release_notes.html"> DDSI2 release notes.</a></li>
          <li>Added support for resource_limits.max_instances QoS on a DataWriter</a></li>
          <li>The size of the OpenSplice shared memory database segment size can now be set
          using "friendlier" terms, such as 256M or 2G.</a></li>
       </ul>
    </p>       
    <h3>OpenSplice DDS V5.4 contains the following new features:</h3>
    <p>
       <ul>
          <li>Robustness added for exhaustion of shared memory. OpenSplice DDS
          will now ensure shared memory does not run out:
          <ul>
             <li>If shared memory is running low then API calls that allocate
             resources (such as write) will return out of resources. Calls that
             do not allocate resources like delete calls or lookup calls are still allowed.
             </li>
             <li>Minimum shared memory size has increased from 1MB to 2MB.
             </li>
             <li>A configurable threshold has been added as a sub element under
             the 'Database' element in the XML Configuration. See the deployment
             manual for more info
             </li>
             <li>Configurable warning levels have been added for all resource limits.
             Once certain warning levels are reached a warning message will be printed
             to the info log. This is to help detection of overzealous resource
             usage by applications.  See the deployment manual (New element is
             called 'ResourceLimits' and can be found under the 'Domain' element)
             for more information.
             </li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The OpenSplice daemon can now be installed as a Windows service.
          In order to achieve this you must select the following options during
          product installation:
          <ul>
             <li>OpenSplice Installation Scope - All Users</li>
             <li>Global Data Space Sharing - Share Data Between All Users</li>
             <li>Set-up OpenSplice Environment Variables - Yes</li>
             <li>Install the OpenSplice Daemon as a Windows Service - Yes</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The Windows service will run as the user account LocalSystem and be
          configured for automatic start at machine reboot. You can change
          these values using the Windows MMC Administrative Tools Services snap-in.
          The daemon will run the default configured OpenSplice domain. There is an
          issue with log files when running under a windows service. See the
          <a href="knownissues.html">Known Issues</a>
          </p>
          </li>
          <li>The OpenSplice daemon will now clean up invalid processes and temporary files
          on windows when starting to clear problems caused by an unexpected termination
          of the daemon previously. 
          </li>
          <li>
          Implementation of new APIs:<br>
          DataWriter; get_matched_subscriptions(), get_matched_subscription_data()
          and get_publication_matched_status()<br>
          DataReader; get_matched_publications(), get_matched_publication_data() and
          get_subscription_matched_status()<br>
          DataWriterListener; on_publication_matched()<br>
          DataReaderListener; on_subscription_matched()
          </li>
         <li>Support for Windows CE 6.0 armv4i platform (32bit)
          </li>
          <li>Secure Networking support for Windows CE 6.0 armv4i platform (32bit)
          </li>
          <li>Support for VxWorks 5.5.1 PENTIUM target hosted on WindowsXP (32bit)
          </li>
          <li>DLRL is now supported on Windows platforms
          </li>
          <li>
          <p>New DDS Examples have been added for enterprise platforms (see the examples directory)
             <ul>
               <li>BuiltInTopics - The BuiltInTopics example is used to illustrate
               the use of built-in topics to obtain and print all nodes running 
               in the domain.
               </li>
               <li>ContentFilteredTopic - The StockQuote example is used to 
               illustrate message filtering based upon Content-Based subscription.
               </li>
               <li>Durability - The durability example illustrates the ability 
               of late joining readers to obtain data that has already been 
               published before these readers were created.
               </li>
               <li>HelloWorld - The basic HelloWorld example is used to illustrate
               the necessary steps to setup DCPS entities.
               </li>
               <li>Listener - The HelloWorld_Listener example is used to 
               illustrate use of listeners.
               </li>
               <li>Ownership - The ownership example is used to illustrate the 
               concept of Shared Ownership, controlled through QoS.
               </li>
               <li>QueryCondition - The StockQuote example is used to illustrate 
               message filtering through use of Queries.
               </li>
               <li>WaitSet - The basic HelloWorld_Waitset example is used to 
               illustrate the use of waitset and Read, Status, Query and Guard 
               conditions.
               </li>
               <li>Lifecycle - The Lifecycle example is used to illustrate the 
               different lifecycle states of the sample and the instance.
               </li> 
            </ul>
          <p>
          <a href="../../examples/dcps/README.html">See the new examples html for further information</a> 
          </p>
          </p>
          </li>
          <li>The src/api/cm/jni component which was part of the commercial source
          code base has been moved to the opensource source code base.
          </li>
          <li>OpenSplice's default network configuration at version 5.3 used ports
              53340, 53350, & 53360. These ports were also used as the default for
              some incompatible OpenSplice 4.x versions. Running incompatible 
              versions of OpenSplice on the same ports produced warnings in the 
              OpenSplice Info log. To help avoid this situation OpenSplice 5.4 
              ships with a default configuration of ports 53370, 53380, & 53390.
          </li>
       </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>OpenSplice DDS V5.3 contains the following new features:</h3>
    <p>
       <ul>
          <li>Merge Policies
          <p>
             So far the OpenSplice DDS durability service was not able to handle 
             the so-called "split-brain syndrome". A split-brain syndrome can be 
             described as the situation in which two different nodes (possibly) 
             have a different perception on (part of) the set of historical 
             data. This split-brain occurs when two nodes or two sets of nodes 
             (i.e. two systems) that are participating in the same DDS domain 
             have been running separately for some time and suddenly get 
             connected to each other. Equally this syndrome arises when nodes 
             re-connect after being disconnected for some time. Applications on 
             these nodes may have been publishing information for the same topic 
             in the same partition without this information reaching the other 
             party. Therefore their perception on the set of data will be 
             different.
             
             Because of the new emerging environments in which OpenSplice DDS 
             is deployed, the durability service has been extended with 
             additional functionality to support the alignment of historical 
             data when two nodes get connected. Of course, the basic use case 
             of a newly started node joining an existing system is supported, 
             but in contradiction to that situation there is no universal truth 
             in determining who has the best (or the right) information when 
             two already running nodes (re)connect.  When this situation 
             occurs, the durability service now provides the possibility to 
             configure its behaviour in this situation in the form of so-called 
             merge policies. The following options are supported:
             <ul>
              <li>Ignore (default)<br/>
              Ignore the situation and take no action at all. This means new 
              knowledge is not actively built up. Durability is passive and will 
              only build up knowledge that is implicitly received from that 
              point forward.</li>
              <li>Delete<br/>
              Delete all historical data by deleting all old knowledge and new 
              knowledge is not actively built up. Durability is passive and
              will only build up knowledge that is implicitly received from
              that point forward.</li>
              <li>Replace<br/>
              Replace all historical data by the data set that is available 
              on the connecting node.</li>
              <li>Merge<br/>
              Merge the historical data with the data set that is available 
              on the connecting node.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
         </li>
         <li>Real Time System Monitoring (RTSM) - beta for Linux only
          <p>
             The RunTime System Monitor (RTSM) is a commandline tool that allows
             monitoring of metrics and statistics provided by OpenSplice. It can
             show delta's on for example reader-statistics and reset them. The 
             tool is currently in a beta-stage and is only delivered with 
             Linux-based builds. The tool can be driven through an interactive 
             menu, or by passing options/commands through the command line or a 
             file.
          </p>
          <p>
             The tool contains explanation of the available options, which can 
             be displayed by calling 'rtsm -h'. If you have a domain running 
             with the name "OpenSpliceWithStats", where statistics for readers 
             are enabled, you can issue the following command: <br><br>
             > rtsm -domain OpenSpliceWithStats -count 5 -readerSort -exit<br><br>
             It will first set the domain to "OpenSpliceWithStats". It will set 
             the number of iterations to show statistics to 5, and then run a 
             readerSort. When finished it will exit.<br><br>
             
             The same can be achieved in the interactive mode by calling:<br><br>
             > rtsm <br>
             Then type '4 <RET>' # SETTINGS-menu <br>
             Then type '17 <RET>' # set domain-name <br>
             Then type the domain-name: 'OpenSpliceWithStats <RET>' <br>
             Then type '13 <RET>' # set count <br>
             Then type the count: '5 <RET>' <br>
             Then type '0 <RET>' # back <br>
             Then type '1 <RET>' # show readerSort <br>
             Then, when finished, type '0 <RET>' # exit <br> <br>
             Interactive and commandline-mode can also be combined.
         </p>

       <h3>OpenSplice DDS V5.2.2 contains the following new features:</h3>
       <ul>
          <li>Support for Aonix PERC VM under ElinOS 4.2 on x86 target platform with OpenFusion Real Time ORB Java Edition
          <p>
          When rebuilding the CORBA Java interface, PERC may be used instead of the Sun JDK. Source the percenv.sh script and set SPLICE_JDK=perc
          before running the OpenSplice release.com. This will also cause the example build and run scripts to use PERC.
          </p>
         </li>
       </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
       <h3>OpenSplice DDS V5.2.1 contains the following new features:</h3>
       <ul>
          <li>Support for ElinOS 4.2 on x86 target platform with OpenFusion Real Time ORB Java Edition
         </li>
       </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <h3>OpenSplice DDS V5.2.0p1 contains the following new features:</h3>
       <ul>

        </li>
       </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
       <h3>OpenSplice DDS V5.2 contains the following new features:</h3>
       <ul>
       <li>Dynamic namespaces
      <p>
      The durability service now has the capability to discover namespaces from other nodes at runtime. This can significantly
      reduce configuration effort in large-scale systems, while also enabling OpenSplice to run in more dynamic environments.
      </p>
         </li>
         <li>Support for Solaris 9 gcc 3.4.2 platform
         </li>
         <li>For C# OpenSplice DDS is now available from the Global Assembly Cache
            <p>
            For C#, there is now a signed and versioned Assembly called dcpssacsAssembly.dll, created from the 
            the dcpssacs.dll module, which is added to the Global Assembly cache. In this release, 
            as part of the installation, this is added to the global assembly cache.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>OpenSplice can be configured to allow a single application to operate in multiple domains concurrently
            <p>
             See the OpenSplice Documentation Set for detailed information. 
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>Support for coherent updates
            <p>
             Implementation available for the coherent access PRESENTATION QoS policy for INSTANCE (existing)
             and TOPIC (new) access_scopes <br><br>
             See the OpenSplice Documentation Set for detailed information. 
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>Now provides a way to dispose all the instances of a topic in one call and to notify the
         receivers in one notification.
            <p>
             This functionality allows an application to dispose of all of the instances
             for a particular topic without the overhead of using an individual 
             dispose call for each instance individually. Its effect is equivalent to
             invoking a separate dispose operation for each individual instance
             on the DataWriter that owns it<br<br>
             See the OpenSplice Documentation Set for detailed information.

             examples have been provided to allow users to get started quickly. In a future release
             documentation updates will be made to the manuals.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>Symbolic network interface names supported on Window
            <p>
             With Linux or Unix platforms, it is possible to specify the symbolic name
             of a networking interface to be used, like eth0, eth1, wlan0 etc. In this
             release this concept is now supported on Windows using "friendly names",
             which are unique symbolic names tied to each interface.

       <h3>OpenSplice DDS V5.1 contains the following new features:</h3>
       <ul>
         <li>Compiled with JAVA6
            <p>
             OpenSplice DDS V5.x is compiled with JDK1.6, but can run on a Java 5 JRE as
             the compile flag -source 1.5 is set
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>Data compression at the network level
            <p>
             OpenSplice DDS can be configured to use zlib compression <a href="http://www.zlib.net/"> www.zlib.net</a>
             to compress network packets. See the OpenSplice Documentation set for further information.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>Ability to add your own reporting plugin
            <p>
             OpenSplice DDS can be configured to use an external reporting library.
             See the OpenSplice Documentation set for further information.
             This functionality is not available on the embedded platforms (VxWorks or Integrity)
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>Domain identification
            <p>
             A DomainId consists of a string that represents either a URI to the
             location of the configuration file (e.g. 'file:///projects/DDS/ospl.xml') or the
             Domain name as specified in the configuration file. The actual value returned is
             dependent of the value used when creating the DomainParticipant, also see the
             DomainParticipantFactory create_participant operation. If a DomainParticipant
             is created using the Domain name then it will also return the Domain name and
             visa-versa when created using a URI then the URI will be returned by this
             operation. The configuration file, identified by the URI, specifies all
             configuration details of the Domain
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>C# API is now a fully supported API
            <p>
              <a href="csharp.html">View the C# documentation.</a>
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>Allow multiple installations on Windows
            <p>
             In the V4 series OpenSplice DDS used system wide environment variables.
             With OpenSplice DDS V5.1, these are not set. Note: Users will require
             OpenSplice DDS PowerTools 2.3 to cope with this change.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>Dynamic Discovery
            <p>
            The existing topology-discovery mechanism of OpenSplice's Networking
            Service is extended with a dynamic capability to discover and maintain
            all relevant nodes in large-scale (WAN) systems. In such large-scale
            systems,  static-unicast node pre-definition is not practical nor
            sufficient and dynamic-multicast based discovery is typically not
            supported or even allowed. The new dynamic discovery is based on
            overlaying the physical network with a notion of 'Roles' and 'Scopes'
            that represent 'area-of-interest regions' within the WAN domain such
            that only nodes within the defined scope-of-interest will be
            automatically discovered and their state maintained. In this way,
            the scalability of the dynamic DDS-system is ensured whilst minimizing
            the impact on the overhead of the required discovery process.

            <i>
              With the implementation of IPv6 support a bug was introduced that 
              caused connection problems on Solaris 10 platforms, when using 
              the networking service. This resulted in inability to communicate 
              with other nodes and the following ERROR was reported: 
              "Description : sendto returned errno 22 (Invalid argument)". 
              The root-cause was a wrong sockaddr size that was supplied to

            <b>The same sample is received several times with DDSI2</b><br/>
            <i>
              With DDSI2 time stamps may be off by 1ns and a single sample may 
              be received twice with different time stamps DDSI2 performs 
              conversion between DDS time stamps (seconds + nanoseconds) and 
              DDSI time stamps (64-bit fixed-point with the binary point to the 
              left of bit 31, i.e., seconds + the fraction of a second as a 32 
              bit unsigned integer). The conversion routines contained a 
              rounding error that caused the result of a round-trip through 
              the conversion routines to be 1ns before the original.
              Because of this a data reader on the same node as the data writer 
              would often observe a different source time stamp than a data 
              reader on a remote node connected via DDSI2 did. This is part one 
              of the issue.

              Part two of the issue, receiving a sample multiple times with 
              different source time stamps was caused by an interaction with the 
              durability service alignment procedure. The durability services 
              interact among themselves via a special encoding of the data, 
              which does not suffer from this rounding error. Hence, If a 
              durability service was receiving data from its peer on the node
              where the data was originally published, while the writer was also 
              sending data directly, some samples would arrive twice, with 
              different time stamps. Usually the latency in data forwarding 
              through the durability service is longer than that of the normal 
              data transmission path, and this, combined with the rounding 
              causing the timestamp to be 1ns early, caused the copy received 
              via the durability services to be accepted as a valid new sample.
              <br><br>
              <b>Solution: The conversion routines have been fixed. The DDSI 
              standard does not define the conversion routines in sufficient 
              detail to guarantee that all implementations will interpret time 
              stamps the same way. Similar issues with time stamps may therefore 
              appear in a system environment in which multiple vendors' DDS 
              implementations are interoperating.</b>

               would be available from a different fellow that did meet all merge conditions, or the node

             There are some bad interactions happening between Java’s signal 
             handling and signal handling set up by OpenSplice code. The JVM 
             normally installs a signal handler for some signals, because 
             there are situations where Java uses it internally for instance
             to allocate memory or wake-up a thread. OpenSplice blocks signals
             for a specific thread when accessing shared resources. Blocking
             of these signals prevents proper propagation to the JVM resulting
             in a crash.

              <b>Solution: The blocking of signals is no longer necessary in

              blocked. By pre-loading the jsig library that is delivered with 
              each JVM, signal handlers of OpenSplice and the JVM are chained

              A QueryCondition uses a cache to prevent multiple evaluations of the same sample.

              to a WaitSet, then the sample must be evaluated to determine whether or not to trigger the WaitSet.

              to re-evaluate the full reader content. A flag determines whether the cache is considered incomplete

              with the DDS spec. If the lookup fails, the call should return NULL.

            <i>
              In OpenSpliceDDS 5.4.1 a bug was introduced in the deadline mechanism. This bug occurred
              in the scenario where an existing deadline duration for a datareader or datawriter was 
              updated to a new, for example shorter, duration. The new (shorter) deadline duration did
              not come into effect immediately, but only after the previous (longer) deadline had expired
              or if a read or write occurred before the deadline expired. Afterwards the new, shorter,
              duration would be in effect as normal. The same issue occurred for longer durations being set,
              i.e., the deadline would expire based on the previous, shorter, duration. 
              Due to this bug OpenSpliceDDS would not properly indicate the number of deadlines missed in
              specific scenarios. It could be too low or too high.

              required - 4GB, i.e. 5GB would be set to 1GB. The size specified in a config file
              was read in to a 32 bit integer (an unsigned long). Secondly, two additional size parameters
              (Domain->Listeners->StackSize and DurabilityService->Persistent->MemoryMappedFileStore->Size)
              of the config file were not user-friendly interpretable (e.g. 10M instead of 10485760 could not be used).

            <i>
              The splicedaemon is responsible for checking whether heartbeats from
              remote splicedaemons are received to be able to detect a node disconnection.
              When this happens, it is responsible to clean up all resources from
              any entity from that node. This means that all instances that are 
              currently registered by any DataWriter from the disconnected node 
              need to be unregistered. As a result of that, instance states potentially
              change and the same goes for the ownership of (some of) the instances.
              This heartbeat checking mechanism has been implemented in the splicedaemon
              by means of registering a lease with the lease manager. Every time the lease
              expires, the service checks whether the connection with one or more nodes
              has been lost. Due to some re-design the lease to check for heartbeats has been
              replaced by a lease to send heartbeats. As a result, the splicedaemon now sends
              twice the amount of heartbeats it should and is no longer checking incoming
              heartbeats. As a result instance states can become incorrect, ownership is not
              taken over when it should and memory is not cleaned up properly.

              <b>Solution: The faulty lease registration of heartbeat sending has

            <b>Robustness: Improve memory depletion detection so it accounts for free 'reusable' memory as well.</b><br/>
            <i>In the 5.4 release of OpenSplice DDS a new threshold value for the shared memory usage was introduced. 
               When the available shared memory became less then the value of the threshold then OpenSplice DDS would prevent
               further allocations of data within shared memory. In the 5.4 version there was no recovery possible. Even if 
               applications terminated and freed up memory and enough shared memory would be available, OpenSplice DDS would 
               still not allow further allocations.  In effect once the threshold was reached it meant that the deamon had to be restarted.
              <br><br>
              <b>Solution: In this release the algorithm for detecting shared memory depletion has been improved to include freed memory in its calculations.

              Character array fields can be marked to be stored as strings

              to occur within OpenSplice DDS in situations where the listener was processing events while the

              perform various clean functions including stopping the listener thread and then waiting for it to
              terminate. Meanwhile the listener thread could be processing some events and require the mutex lock
              in use by the participant delete function.

              <b>Solution: </b> Fix the delete function of the participant to release the mutex
              while waiting for the listener thread to exit and reclaim it once the exit function returned.

              checks the Microsoft toolchain contains an error when Visual Studio 2008
              is detected. It uses 'cygpath -d' (line: 186) to translate a path 
              but this returns the windows representation of the path (including c:\).
              The result is then appended to the Unix PATH environment variable,

            <i>
              When nodes are aligned simultaneously, it is possible for them
              to detect whether they did receive a consistent (complete) persistent
              data-set or not. In this scenario, these nodes can take action to
              prevent injection of incomplete persistent data the next time the
              node starts.

              However, for late joining nodes there is no way to detect if a
              currently available persistent set is complete/consistent. Therefore,
              if a system would be restarted, and a previous late joining node
              from a system where incomplete persistent data was injected would
              become master for this set, injection of incomplete data would happen.<br/><br/>

            <i>
              <br/>The durability service crashes while tracing information when
              there's a % in the path, because 'fprintf' takes it as format.<br/><br/>
              <b>Solution:</b>The information to print using 'fprintf' is done
              using a format with the string as argument instead of directly
              printing the string.

              Even though no code is generated for (typedefs of) interfaces by
              the IDL pre-processor, it should still allow these constructions
              to be modelled in IDL. <br/><br/>
              <b>Solution:</b>The IDL pre-processor has been modified to ignore
              typedefs of interfaces as well.
