    This page contains a list of all bugfixes and changes incorporated in
    OpenSplice V5.x series of releases<br>

    <h2><a name="highlights">Release Highlights</a></h2>
    <h3>OpenSplice DDS V5.9.1 contains the following new features:</h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
     <li>Adds configurability for data compression in the networking service.
     This allows tuning of the existing (zlib) method, adds two alternative
     fast compressors (lzf and snappy) and provides a plugin api for using
     other mechanisms.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>OpenSplice DDS V5.9.0 contains the following new features:</h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
     <li>Adds an API-call on the DataReader (for C++ and Java) that allows
     properties to be set for the reader, allowing control over some (runtime)
     properties and specifying other hints to the middleware to optimize
     execution.</li>
     <li>Performance optimisation for Java and C++ DataReaders to allow them to
     specify the number of threads to use when de-marshalling data. Demarshalling
     data to a language-binding specific format can take considerable processing
     depending on the type of the data. Before this change this process was single threaded
     and would therefore limit throughput, especially on multi-core platforms.
     See OSPL-1078 in the API changes section.</li>
   </ul>
    <h3>OpenSplice DDS V5.8.0 contains the following new features:</h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
     <li>Changes to the way read- and take-operations access data. The read- and
     take-operations now provide data circularly, meaning that these operations
     will &apos;resume&apos; a previous read just as if read_next_instance was
     successively called. This way all instances can be read even when for
     example lower key-values get updated between two read-operations with a
     max_samples limit.</li>
   </ul>
    <h3>OpenSplice DDS V5.7.2 contains the following new features:</h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
     <li>Changes to the ReportPlugin facility whereby any invalid entries in any specified ReportPlugin configuration
     or any failure to initialize a specified ReportPlugin will result in OpenSplice DDS failing to start.  An
     appropriate error will be logged to the default error log.</li>
   </ul>
    <h3>OpenSplice DDS V5.7.1 contains the following new features:</h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
     <li>Improved memory manager implementation. This can make significant savings on shared memory usage,
     particularly for large numbers of small messages.</li>
   </ul>
    <h3>OpenSplice DDS V5.7.0 contains the following new features:</h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
     <li>Bug fixes only. Please see <a href="#issues_not_api">Fixed Bugs and Changes not affecting API</a> </li>
   </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>OpenSplice DDS V5.6.0 contains the following new features:</h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Customers will benefit from runtime-license-free deployment on Windows,
          Linux and Solaris with the source code being made available under LGPLv3 licensing.
          The commercial 'add-ons' (without source code) are available under the PrismTech Commercial License.
          Optionally, customers can get a full (for all components) PrismTech commercial license for those concerned
          about LGPLv3 licensing.<br>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>OpenSplice DDS V5.5.0 contains the following new features:</h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Support for IPV6 for native networking on Windows, Linux and Solaris.<br>
      <li>DDSI2 improvements, including fragmentation for large messages. <a href="ddsi2_release_notes.html">See the DDSI2 release notes for more information.</a><br>
      </li>
      <li>Support for the get_discovered_xxx() APIs</b><br/>
          DomainParticipant; get_discovered_participants(), get_discovered_particpant_data(),
          get_discovered_topics() and get_discovered_topic_data() for C, C++ and Java.</li>
      <li>DDSI1 is now removed from the runtime, but is available as source code. Note: This source
      will be removed when OpenSplice v6 series is released. We recommend any DDSI1 users transition to
      DDSI2.
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>OpenSplice DDS V5.4.2 contains the following new features:</h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Bounded strings as character array.<br>
         In some use cases a large number of (relatively small) strings may be used in the data
         model and because each string is a reference type, it means that it is not stored inline in
         the datamodel but instead as a pointer. This will result in separate allocations for each
         string (and thus a performance penalty when writing data) and a slight increase in
         memory usage due to pointers and (memory storage) headers for each string.
         The OpenSplice DDS IDL Pre-Processor features a special pragma called stac which
         can be utilized in such use cases. This pragma allows one to indicate that OpenSplice
         DDS should store strings internally as character arrays (but on API level are still bounded
         strings). Because a character array has a fixed size, the pragma stac only effects
         bounded strings. By storing the strings internally as a character array the number of
         allocations is reduced and less memory is used. This is most effective in a scenario
         where a typical string has a relatively small size, e.g. less then 100 characters.<br><br>
         See the IDL Pre-processor user guide for detailed information.
      </li>
      <li>Improved performance for durability using memory mapped persistence by adding multi-threading capability.
         See the reference manual for more information.</li>
     <li>Improved footprint by separation of the key value from a sample. As a
         result only the key value needs to be stored for disposes and
         registrations of an instance. This improves footprint considerably in
         case the key value is just a small part of the entire sample.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>OpenSplice DDS V5.4.1 contains the following new features:</h3>
    <p>
       <ul>
          <li>A brand new beta implementation of DDSI, known now as DDSI2 is now released.
          In this release the old DDSI is still available, but is now deprecated and
          will be removed in the next major/minor release.
          For more information on what DDSI2 supports then see the
          <a href="ddsi2_release_notes.html"> DDSI2 release notes.</a></li>
          <li>Added support for resource_limits.max_instances QoS on a DataWriter</a></li>
          <li>The size of the OpenSplice shared memory database segment size can now be set
          using "friendlier" terms, such as 256M or 2G.</a></li>
          <li>Support for windows hosted VxWorks 6.8 PENTIUM4.</li>
          <li>Support for windows hosted VxWorks 6.7.1 SIMPENTIUM.</li>
          <li>Support for windows and linux hosted VxWorks 6.5 PPC32.</li>
          <li>Support for linux hosted VxWorks 6.5 PPC604.</li>
       </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>OpenSplice DDS V5.4 contains the following new features:</h3>
    <p>
       <ul>
          <li>Robustness added for exhaustion of shared memory. OpenSplice DDS
          will now ensure shared memory does not run out:
          <ul>
             <li>If shared memory is running low then API calls that allocate
             resources (such as write) will return out of resources. Calls that
             do not allocate resources like delete calls or lookup calls are still allowed.
             </li>
             <li>Minimum shared memory size has increased from 1MB to 2MB.
             </li>
             <li>A configurable threshold has been added as a sub element under
             the 'Database' element in the XML Configuration. See the deployment
             manual for more info
             </li>
             <li>Configurable warning levels have been added for all resource limits.
             Once certain warning levels are reached a warning message will be printed
             to the info log. This is to help detection of overzealous resource
             usage by applications.  See the deployment manual (New element is
             called 'ResourceLimits' and can be found under the 'Domain' element)
             for more information.
             </li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The OpenSplice daemon can now be installed as a Windows service.
          In order to achieve this you must select the following options during
          product installation:
          <ul>
             <li>OpenSplice Installation Scope - All Users</li>
             <li>Global Data Space Sharing - Share Data Between All Users</li>
             <li>Set-up OpenSplice Environment Variables - Yes</li>
             <li>Install the OpenSplice Daemon as a Windows Service - Yes</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The Windows service will run as the user account LocalSystem and be
          configured for automatic start at machine reboot. You can change
          these values using the Windows MMC Administrative Tools Services snap-in.
          The daemon will run the default configured OpenSplice domain. There is an
          issue with log files when running under a windows service. See the
          <a href="knownissues.html">Known Issues</a>
          </p>
          </li>
          <li>The OpenSplice daemon will now clean up invalid processes and temporary files
          on windows when starting to clear problems caused by an unexpected termination
          of the daemon previously.
          </li>
          <li>
          Implementation of new APIs:<br>
          DataWriter; get_matched_subscriptions(), get_matched_subscription_data()
          and get_publication_matched_status()<br>
          DataReader; get_matched_publications(), get_matched_publication_data() and
          get_subscription_matched_status()<br>
          DataWriterListener; on_publication_matched()<br>
          DataReaderListener; on_subscription_matched()
          </li>
         <li>Support for Windows CE 6.0 armv4i platform (32bit)
          </li>

          </li>
          <li>Support for VxWorks 5.5.1 PENTIUM target hosted on WindowsXP (32bit)
          </li>
          <li>DLRL is now supported on Windows platforms
          </li>
          <li>
          <p>New DDS Examples have been added for enterprise platforms (see the examples directory)
             <ul>
               <li>BuiltInTopics - The BuiltInTopics example is used to illustrate
               the use of built-in topics to obtain and print all nodes running
               in the domain.
               </li>
               <li>ContentFilteredTopic - The StockQuote example is used to
               illustrate message filtering based upon Content-Based subscription.
               </li>
               <li>Durability - The durability example illustrates the ability
               of late joining readers to obtain data that has already been
               published before these readers were created.
               </li>
               <li>HelloWorld - The basic HelloWorld example is used to illustrate
               the necessary steps to setup DCPS entities.
               </li>
               <li>Listener - The HelloWorld_Listener example is used to
               illustrate use of listeners.
               </li>
               <li>Ownership - The ownership example is used to illustrate the
               concept of Shared Ownership, controlled through QoS.
               </li>
               <li>QueryCondition - The StockQuote example is used to illustrate
               message filtering through use of Queries.
               </li>
               <li>WaitSet - The basic HelloWorld_Waitset example is used to
               illustrate the use of waitset and Read, Status, Query and Guard
               conditions.
               </li>
               <li>Lifecycle - The Lifecycle example is used to illustrate the
               different lifecycle states of the sample and the instance.
               </li>
            </ul>
          <p>
          <a href="../../examples/dcps/README.html">See the new examples html for further information</a>
          </p>
          </p>
          </li>
          <li>The src/api/cm/jni component which was part of the commercial source
          code base has been moved to the opensource source code base.
          </li>
          <li>OpenSplice's default network configuration at version 5.3 used ports
              53340, 53350, & 53360. These ports were also used as the default for
              some incompatible OpenSplice 4.x versions. Running incompatible
              versions of OpenSplice on the same ports produced warnings in the
              OpenSplice Info log. To help avoid this situation OpenSplice 5.4
              ships with a default configuration of ports 53370, 53380, & 53390.
          </li>
       </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>OpenSplice DDS V5.3 contains the following new features:</h3>
    <p>
       <ul>
          <li>Merge Policies
          <p>
             So far the OpenSplice DDS durability service was not able to handle
             the so-called "split-brain syndrome". A split-brain syndrome can be
             described as the situation in which two different nodes (possibly)
             have a different perception on (part of) the set of historical
             data. This split-brain occurs when two nodes or two sets of nodes
             (i.e. two systems) that are participating in the same DDS domain
             have been running separately for some time and suddenly get
             connected to each other. Equally this syndrome arises when nodes
             re-connect after being disconnected for some time. Applications on
             these nodes may have been publishing information for the same topic
             in the same partition without this information reaching the other
             party. Therefore their perception on the set of data will be
             different.

             Because of the new emerging environments in which OpenSplice DDS
             is deployed, the durability service has been extended with
             additional functionality to support the alignment of historical
             data when two nodes get connected. Of course, the basic use case
             of a newly started node joining an existing system is supported,
             but in contradiction to that situation there is no universal truth
             in determining who has the best (or the right) information when
             two already running nodes (re)connect.  When this situation
             occurs, the durability service now provides the possibility to
             configure its behaviour in this situation in the form of so-called
             merge policies. The following options are supported:
             <ul>
              <li>Ignore (default)<br/>
              Ignore the situation and take no action at all. This means new
              knowledge is not actively built up. Durability is passive and will
              only build up knowledge that is implicitly received from that
              point forward.</li>
              <li>Delete<br/>
              Delete all historical data by deleting all old knowledge and new
              knowledge is not actively built up. Durability is passive and
              will only build up knowledge that is implicitly received from
              that point forward.</li>
              <li>Replace<br/>
              Replace all historical data by the data set that is available
              on the connecting node.</li>
              <li>Merge<br/>
              Merge the historical data with the data set that is available
              on the connecting node.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
         </li>
         <li>Real Time System Monitoring (RTSM) - beta for Linux only
          <p>
             The RunTime System Monitor (RTSM) is a commandline tool that allows
             monitoring of metrics and statistics provided by OpenSplice. It can
             show delta's on for example reader-statistics and reset them. The
             tool is currently in a beta-stage and is only delivered with
             Linux-based builds. The tool can be driven through an interactive
             menu, or by passing options/commands through the command line or a
             file.
          </p>
          <p>
             The tool contains explanation of the available options, which can
             be displayed by calling 'rtsm -h'. If you have a domain running
             with the name "OpenSpliceWithStats", where statistics for readers
             are enabled, you can issue the following command: <br><br>
             > rtsm -domain OpenSpliceWithStats -count 5 -readerSort -exit<br><br>
             It will first set the domain to "OpenSpliceWithStats". It will set
             the number of iterations to show statistics to 5, and then run a
             readerSort. When finished it will exit.<br><br>

             The same can be achieved in the interactive mode by calling:<br><br>
             > rtsm <br>
             Then type '4 <RET>' # SETTINGS-menu <br>
             Then type '17 <RET>' # set domain-name <br>
             Then type the domain-name: 'OpenSpliceWithStats <RET>' <br>
             Then type '13 <RET>' # set count <br>
             Then type the count: '5 <RET>' <br>
             Then type '0 <RET>' # back <br>
             Then type '1 <RET>' # show readerSort <br>
             Then, when finished, type '0 <RET>' # exit <br> <br>
             Interactive and commandline-mode can also be combined.

            <p>
             This functionality allows an application to dispose of all of the instances
             for a particular topic without the overhead of using an individual
             dispose call for each instance individually. Its effect is equivalent to
             invoking a separate dispose operation for each individual instance

       <h3>OpenSplice DDS V5.1.1 contains the following new features:</h3>
       <ul>
         <li>Support for Windows 7 platform
            <p>
             Added Windows 7 32 bit support with Microsoft Visual Studio 2008.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>Support for OpenFusion Real Time ORB Java Edition
            <p>
             OpenFusion Real Time ORB Java Edition is now tested with OpenSplice DDS. Additional
             examples have been provided to allow users to get started quickly. In a future release
             documentation updates will be made to the manuals.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>Symbolic network interface names supported on Window
            <p>
             With Linux or Unix platforms, it is possible to specify the symbolic name
             of a networking interface to be used, like eth0, eth1, wlan0 etc. In this
             release this concept is now supported on Windows using "friendly names",
             which are unique symbolic names tied to each interface.
            </p>
         </li>
       </ul>
    </p>

       <h3>OpenSplice DDS V5.1 contains the following new features:</h3>
       <ul>
         <li>Compiled with JAVA6
            <p>
             OpenSplice DDS V5.x is compiled with JDK1.6, but can run on a Java 5 JRE as
             the compile flag -source 1.5 is set
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>Data compression at the network level
            <p>
             OpenSplice DDS can be configured to use zlib compression <a href="http://www.zlib.net/"> www.zlib.net</a>
             to compress network packets. See the OpenSplice Documentation set for further information.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>Ability to add your own reporting plugin
            <p>
             OpenSplice DDS can be configured to use an external reporting library.
             See the OpenSplice Documentation set for further information.
             This functionality is not available on the embedded platforms (VxWorks or Integrity)
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>Domain identification
            <p>
             A DomainId consists of a string that represents either a URI to the
             location of the configuration file (e.g. 'file:///projects/DDS/ospl.xml') or the
             Domain name as specified in the configuration file. The actual value returned is
             dependent of the value used when creating the DomainParticipant, also see the
             DomainParticipantFactory create_participant operation. If a DomainParticipant
             is created using the Domain name then it will also return the Domain name and
             visa-versa when created using a URI then the URI will be returned by this
             operation. The configuration file, identified by the URI, specifies all
             configuration details of the Domain
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>C# API is now a fully supported API
            <p>
              <a href="csharp.html">View the C# documentation.</a>
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>Allow multiple installations on Windows
            <p>
             In the V4 series OpenSplice DDS used system wide environment variables.
             With OpenSplice DDS V5.1, these are not set. Note: Users will require
             OpenSplice DDS PowerTools 2.3 to cope with this change.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>Dynamic Discovery
            <p>
            The existing topology-discovery mechanism of OpenSplice's Networking
            Service is extended with a dynamic capability to discover and maintain
            all relevant nodes in large-scale (WAN) systems. In such large-scale
            systems,  static-unicast node pre-definition is not practical nor
            sufficient and dynamic-multicast based discovery is typically not
            supported or even allowed. The new dynamic discovery is based on
            overlaying the physical network with a notion of 'Roles' and 'Scopes'
            that represent 'area-of-interest regions' within the WAN domain such
            that only nodes within the defined scope-of-interest will be
            automatically discovered and their state maintained. In this way,
            the scalability of the dynamic DDS-system is ensured whilst minimizing
            the impact on the overhead of the required discovery process.

               If a service dies it may not have performed a detach from the 
               OpenSplice kernel/database and so the attached services count may
                be incorrect. That could lead to a crash of a database thread
                because the spliced may get detached too early.
              <br><br>
              <b>Solution: When spliced detects that a service has died, it 
              ensures that attached services count is correctly maintained,

         The dispose_all_data operation on the topic was not treated identically
         to sending a separate dispose message for every entity. This manifested
         itself especially in the way the disposed data was delivered to late
         joiners (which sometimes couldn't see that the data was actually disposed)
         and in the way disposed data ignored the cleanup delay specified on the
         durability service. 
         <br><br>
         <b>Solution: The new implementation of dispose_all_data is much
         more inline with sending separate dispose messages for every instance,
         and thus late joiners will always see the correct instance state.
         Furthermore the dispose messages obey the same cleanup delays as normal
         dispose messages. However, the dispose_all_data function will still be
         me more efficient with respect to the utilization of network network
         bandwitdth, CPU cycles and memory than the manual transmission of
         separate dispose messages.</b>

        <i>
          The copy functions that are used to copy data from the shared memory representation
          into their Java language representation and vice-versa were not optimal under all conditions.
          Especially the combination of enums/unions and an external IDL compiler (in CORBA
          cohabitation mode for Java) resulted in additional JNI transitions due to the fact
          that the copy functions had no a-priory knowledge about their actual implementation.
          In these cases the copy functions had to revert to invoking the IDL mandated manipulation
          operations instead directly setting the underlying attributes, and each time a Java
          operation needed to be invoked added the overhead of one additional JNI transition.
          <br><br>
          <b>Solution: The copy functions have now been adapted to use, besides the a-priori
          knowledge about the idlpp output in StandAlone mode, also a-priori knowledge about
          the exact layout for enums/unions generated by the JacORB V2.3.x compiler. Therefore
          there is not need to make additional JNI transitions when manipulating types that
          match one of aforementioned layout, thereby reducing the time required to read and
          write these types. CopyCache administration is now completely separated
          for the a-priory supported IDL layouts (idlpp native output and JacORB V2.3 output)
          and the non-recognized IDL layouts. In the first case it will store jfieldIDs,
          in the latter jmethodIDs. Both layouts now have their own copy functions.</b>

              <b>Solution: This size is now configurable using Unsupported/FragmentSize,

            <b>Delayed initial durability alignment</b><br/>
            <i>
              Previously, when a system had a late-joining node with persistent data,
              this persistent data was not injected. This behavior was considered valid,
              since it can be disruptive to inject historical data in a running system.
              However, in a system where no data has been written, it can be desirable
              to do a delayed injection of persistent data from a late-joining node.
              <br><br>
              <b>Solution: A new option has been implemented where, in the case where no
              writer has been created in any of the partitions in a durability namespace,
              persistent data from a late-joining node can still be aligned.
              This functionality has to be explicitly configured on a namespace policy,
              using the delayedAlignment option. See the configurator tool (osplconf)
              for more details.</b>

              (in case of the 't' or '-T' mode) by objectCount/objectSize/TotalSize.
              This helps you to focus on those object types that have the most impact
              on the consumption of shared memory, by listing the biggest
              objectCount/objectSize/TotalSize on the top. You can also limit the

              a lot of memory could be saved if the database allocates 1 empty

              default string (increasing its reference count accordingly) when an
              empty string needs to be expressed.

              Since each splice deamon has its own private instance, consecutive

              In some scenarios the mmf store failed to inject its persistent topic definitions when started from a

              recorded the wrong entry-point for its persistent datatypes: instead of pointing directly to the structured
              datatype definition it was pointing to the outer-most module of this datatype. In case other datatypes
              were specified in the same module, the deserializer would try to deserialize all datatypes from that module
              at the same time.

              <b>Solution: Those issues have now been fixed by making sure that the a clone on a type definition

            <b>Networking service crashed on startup when no network interfaces found.</b><br/>
            <i>
              If the OpenSplice native networking service was started before any network
              interfaces were available from the operating system, it would lead to undefined
              behaviour.  This has been corrected and the behaviour now is that the networking
              service will write a message to the ospl-error.log indicating that no interfaces
              could be found and networking will then terminate.
              <br><br>
              <b>Solution: The networking service will now exit gracefully and not crash if
                it cannot find any network interfaces it can bind to. It is a requirement
                that OpenSplice can only be started once the operating system is fully active
                and a network interface is available to allow the networking service to run.

              The implemented signal handling for POSIX platforms makes it
              impossible to generate application core files because the

            <i>
              Within OpenSpliceDDS a problem existed surrounding the creating of a DataReader
              with a Topic that was the result of a 'find_topic' call. The typeSupport that
              is needed by a DataReader must be registered for the same type name as used
              to create the DataReader's Topic. A Topic resolved by 'find_topic' call is
              implicitly created by using the default type name (the IDL type name).
              So if the DomainParticipant has registered the TypeSupport using an alias name
              that is different than the default name then OpenSpliceDDS will not be able
              to find the TypeSupport by its default name.
              <br><br>
              <b>Solution: The solution is that whenever a TypeSupport is registered it is
              now also always registered by its default name.</b>

            <i>
              With DDSI2 time stamps may be off by 1ns and a single sample may
              be received twice with different time stamps DDSI2 performs
              conversion between DDS time stamps (seconds + nanoseconds) and
              DDSI time stamps (64-bit fixed-point with the binary point to the
              left of bit 31, i.e., seconds + the fraction of a second as a 32
              bit unsigned integer). The conversion routines contained a
              rounding error that caused the result of a round-trip through
              the conversion routines to be 1ns before the original.
              Because of this a data reader on the same node as the data writer
              would often observe a different source time stamp than a data
              reader on a remote node connected via DDSI2 did. This is part one
              of the issue.

              Part two of the issue, receiving a sample multiple times with
              different source time stamps was caused by an interaction with the
              durability service alignment procedure. The durability services
              interact among themselves via a special encoding of the data,
              which does not suffer from this rounding error. Hence, If a
              durability service was receiving data from its peer on the node
              where the data was originally published, while the writer was also
              sending data directly, some samples would arrive twice, with
              different time stamps. Usually the latency in data forwarding
              through the durability service is longer than that of the normal
              data transmission path, and this, combined with the rounding
              causing the timestamp to be 1ns early, caused the copy received
              via the durability services to be accepted as a valid new sample.
              <br><br>
              <b>Solution: The conversion routines have been fixed. The DDSI
              standard does not define the conversion routines in sufficient
              detail to guarantee that all implementations will interpret time
              stamps the same way. Similar issues with time stamps may therefore
              appear in a system environment in which multiple vendors' DDS
              implementations are interoperating.</b>

               The merge policy mechanism would check if a potential merge fellow had confirmed its master.
               An unconfirmed master was a reason to not merge, since it was assumed that merging
               with an inconsistent node would unnecessarily cause a network load while the same data
               would be available from a different fellow that did meet all merge conditions, or the node
               would cause a new merge trigger as soon as it did confirm its master. There are however
               situations in systems with multiple nodes and roles, where data can only be retrieved by
               merging with a fellow even if that did not confirm its master yet.

            <i>
             There are some bad interactions happening between Java's signal
             handling and signal handling set up by OpenSplice code. The JVM
             normally installs a signal handler for some signals, because
             there are situations where Java uses it internally for instance
             to allocate memory or wake-up a thread. OpenSplice blocks signals
             for a specific thread when accessing shared resources. Blocking
             of these signals prevents proper propagation to the JVM resulting
             in a crash.
              <br><br>
              <b>Solution: The blocking of signals is no longer necessary in

              with a dedicated thread and therefore threads are now no longer
              blocked. By pre-loading the jsig library that is delivered with
              each JVM, signal handlers of OpenSplice and the JVM are chained
              correctly and signals are handled by the correct signal handler.</b>

            <i>
              A QueryCondition uses a cache to prevent multiple evaluations of the same sample.
              When a sample is inserted into a Reader that has a corresponding QueryCondition attached
              to a WaitSet, then the sample must be evaluated to determine whether or not to trigger the WaitSet.
              This evaluation result is then cached so that when a user reads/takes from the query, it does not need
              to re-evaluate the full reader content. A flag determines whether the cache is considered incomplete
              (i.e. the reader still contains samples that need to be evaluated) or whether the contents of the
              cache reflect all matching samples.<br><br>
              Due to an error in the query caching algorithm, the cache was only taking
              into account incoming samples when the query was attached to a WaitSet.
              This meant that the query cache could indicate that is was complete,
              while in fact the query still needed to evaluate some samples to substantiate that claim.

            <i>
              There are no configuration options available to adjust the scheduling properties
              of the main splice deamon thread. This thread is responsible for the renewal
              of the liveliness lease of the splice deamon. By the inability to configure
              the scheduling properties there can be problems when the lease renewal time is set
              to a very small period. The splice deamon thread will then potentially not be able to renew
              the lease in time and thus will be considered dead to the services, whom will
              then terminate.

            <b>Deadline mechanism misbehaves when changing the deadline duration to a new value.</b><br/>
            <i>
              In OpenSpliceDDS 5.4.1 a bug was introduced in the deadline mechanism. This bug occurred
              in the scenario where an existing deadline duration for a datareader or datawriter was
              updated to a new, for example shorter, duration. The new (shorter) deadline duration did
              not come into effect immediately, but only after the previous (longer) deadline had expired
              or if a read or write occurred before the deadline expired. Afterwards the new, shorter,
              duration would be in effect as normal. The same issue occurred for longer durations being set,
              i.e., the deadline would expire based on the previous, shorter, duration.
              Due to this bug OpenSpliceDDS would not properly indicate the number of deadlines missed in
              specific scenarios. It could be too low or too high.
              <br><br>
              <b>Solution: The bug in OpenSpliceDDS has been resolved and new durations being set are now

              has caused any shared memory database sizes over 4GB to be set to size
              required - 4GB, i.e. 5GB would be set to 1GB. The size specified in a config file
              was read in to a 32 bit integer (an unsigned long). Secondly, two additional size parameters
              (Domain->Listeners->StackSize and DurabilityService->Persistent->MemoryMappedFileStore->Size)
              of the config file were not user-friendly interpretable (e.g. 10M instead of 10485760 could not be used).

            <i>
              The splicedaemon is responsible for checking whether heartbeats from
              remote splicedaemons are received to be able to detect a node disconnection.
              When this happens, it is responsible to clean up all resources from
              any entity from that node. This means that all instances that are
              currently registered by any DataWriter from the disconnected node
              need to be unregistered. As a result of that, instance states potentially
              change and the same goes for the ownership of (some of) the instances.
              This heartbeat checking mechanism has been implemented in the splicedaemon
              by means of registering a lease with the lease manager. Every time the lease
              expires, the service checks whether the connection with one or more nodes
              has been lost. Due to some re-design the lease to check for heartbeats has been
              replaced by a lease to send heartbeats. As a result, the splicedaemon now sends
              twice the amount of heartbeats it should and is no longer checking incoming
              heartbeats. As a result instance states can become incorrect, ownership is not
              taken over when it should and memory is not cleaned up properly.
              <br><br>
              <b>Solution: The faulty lease registration of heartbeat sending has
              been replaced by a heartbeat checking lease registration to make

              the duration of the lease should be configured to a shorter time value. This lease duration

              <b>Solution: </b>On Windows, "ospl start" has been improved to check for and remove

              In future releases this will be improved to remove OpenSplice processes that may be

            platforms, but the suitability of this value will vary depending on
            the size of the database that is required, and also with the process
            properties at the operating system level. If the address is not
            suitable, the error log file will describe this. On linux the
            "pmap" utility when ran with the "-x" option can be used to view
            the mapping addresses in use by a particular process.  A mapping
            address value is suitable if the addresses that immediately follow
            it (up to the size of the required database) are not in use.

              is detected. It uses 'cygpath -d' (line: 186) to translate a path
              but this returns the windows representation of the path (including c:\).
              The result is then appended to the Unix PATH environment variable,

            <i>
              When nodes are aligned simultaneously, it is possible for them
              to detect whether they did receive a consistent (complete) persistent
              data-set or not. In this scenario, these nodes can take action to
              prevent injection of incomplete persistent data the next time the
              node starts.

              However, for late joining nodes there is no way to detect if a
              currently available persistent set is complete/consistent. Therefore,
              if a system would be restarted, and a previous late joining node
              from a system where incomplete persistent data was injected would
              become master for this set, injection of incomplete data would happen.<br/><br/>

            <b>Support for parallel demarshalling should be available on Java an C++ </b><br/>
            <i>
               Demarshalling data to a language-binding specific format may take considerable
               processing depending on the type of the data. Since demarshalling is done by the
               application thread performing the read/take, demarshalling occurs single-threadedly,
               limiting the throughput that can be achieved.<br>
               <b>Solution:</b> The C++ and Java datareaders have been extended with support for
               demarshalling with multiple threads. The number of threads used can be controlled
               by using the new set_property(String, String) operation on C++ and Java datareaders.
               The property "parallelReadThreadCount" accepts a string representing a positive integer
               (e.g., "4") as value. If the call was successful, successive read/take operations on
               that datareader will use the provided number of threads for the demarshalling step of
               the respective operations.
               <pre>
                  dr.set_property("parallelReadThreadCount", "4");
