    <p>
        The OpenSplice DDS DCPS API for the C++ language binding with Corba
        cohabitation is delivered using the OpenFusion TAO ORB and a specific
        compiler. The ORB 'OpenFusion TAO' can be obtained from PrismTech
        (<a href="http://www.prismtech.com" target="web">www.prismtech.com</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
        The OpenSplice DDS distribution contains a directory 
        <b>custom_lib/ccpp</b> containing the source code for building your own
        Corba C++ API library for an ORB of your choice and compiler of your
        choice. Located in this directory is a <b>README</b> file, describing
        how to generate this custom library.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="sacpp">Building your own Standalone C++ API</a></h2>
    <p>
        The OpenSplice DDS DCPS API for the C++ language binding without Corba
        cohabitation is delivered using a specific compiler.
    </p>
    <p>
        To be able to use a different compiler with the OpenSplice DDS
        Standalone C++ API, we deliver the source code for this language with
        the OpenSplice DDS distribution. This is contained in a directory
        <b>custom_lib/sacpp</b> along with a <b>README</b> file describing how
        to generate the custom library.
    <p>

    <h2><a name="java">Building your own Corba Java API</a></h2>
    <p>
        The OpenSplice DDS DCPS API for the Java language binding with Corba
        cohabitation is built with OpenFusion JacORB.  The ORB 'OpenFusion
        JacORB' can be obtained from PrismTech
        (<a href="http://www.prismtech.com" target="web">www.prismtech.com</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
        The OpenSplice DDS Corba Java API can also be rebuilt against another
        CORBA compliant Java ORB. Rebuilding using the Aonix PERC compiler is
        also supported. A directory <b>custom_lib/cj</b> contains the necessary
        source code, along with a <b>README</b> file which describes how to
        generate the custom library.
