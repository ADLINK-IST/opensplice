how to use an external logging provider with OpenSplice DDS. This is provided as

<h2>Make, Project and workspace Creator. Source location: submods/MPC_ROOT</h2>
MPC (Licensed Product) is protected by copyright, and is distributed under
the following terms.<br><br>

MPC (Make, Project and workspace Creator) is an open source tool, developed
by OCI and written in Perl. It is designed to generate a variety of tool
specific project files from a common baseline. Through the powerful
combination of inheritance and defaults MPC is able to reduce the
maintenance burden normally associated with keeping multiple target
platforms, their unique build tools, and inconsistent feature sets current.
It is also easily extensible to support new build environments. The
objective is to solve the prevalent problem of fragile build environments,
usually experienced by developer groups, by replacing it with a singular
robust build environment, and an active community of users committed to its
evolution.<br><br>

Since MPC is open source and free of licensing fees, you are free to use,
modify, and distribute the source code, as long as you include this
copyright statement.<br><br>

In particular, you can use MPC to build proprietary software and are under
no obligation to redistribute any of your source code that is built using
MPC. Note, however, that you may not do anything to the MPC code, such as
copyrighting it yourself or claiming authorship of the MPC code, that will
prevent MPC from being distributed freely using an open source development
model.<br><br>
