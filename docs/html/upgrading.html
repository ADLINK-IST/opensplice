    <h2><a name="versionswitch">Switching to the next OpenSplice DDS version</a></h2>
      <p>
        OpenSplice DDS uses a versioning policy, which reflects the severity i.e.
        impact of the changes applied. Impact of any change can be on portability
        as well as on interoperability. Portability aspects are typically driven by
        changes in (existing) APIs whereas interoperability aspects are typically
        driven by changes in DDS (wire-)protocols. With the related OMG specifications
        (DDS rev 1.2, DDSI rev2.1) becoming more mature as well as the adoption of
        extensible wire-protocols, interoperability can be increasingly guaranteed
        as explained below.
        <p>
        <p>
        The OpenSplice DDS version consists of 3 digits: major, minor and maintenance
        (in that order). Additionally, there may be patch releases made available
        for customers with appropriate support contracts. The impact of major/minor/
        maintenance release updates on installation, coding and coding/generation
        is as follows:
        <ul>
           <li>
            <b>Major:</b> A Major release typically indicates some major functional
            additions to the product and/or high-impact changes to existing functionality.
            These changes could be syntactic and/or behavioral changes on existing
            DDS APIs. A Major release is always accompanied by a migration guide
            detailing the DDS API changes and in case of behavioral changes, it
            contains recommendations (if possible) on how to either mimic the
            old behavior or migrate towards the new behavior. <br><br>
            Whereas wire-protocol interoperability is now guaranteed within a
            major release (i.e. for all minor releases), interoperability between
            major versions is a design-goal rather than a guarantee as there can
            be evolutions in the wire-protocol specification(s) and/or its
            implementation that would demand upgrading to the same major release.
            The Release-notes of each major release will clearly indicate when a
            new major release is NOT backwards-compatible with the previous one.<br><br>
            The actions to take upon changing to a new major release are:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Installing/Interoperability: In case of indicated non-compatibility
                with the previous major release, the new major release must be
                installed on all computing nodes of the distributed system and
                old persistent-stores (that relate to data of the old major
                release) must potentially be deleted (if release notes of the new
                major release so indicate)
              </li>
              <li>
                Coding: Application code has to be adapted if and only if an
                application uses APIs that have either been changed syntactically
                or changed behaviorally.Please check the migration guide to see
                if this applies to your application
              </li>
              <li>
                Compiling: Applications that are to be ran on the new major release
                shall be re-generated using the related OpenSplice DDS IDL preprocessor
                followed by compilation
                of the generated code with a compile-suite (-version) suitable for
                the new major release of OpenSplice (as indicated in the release-notes)
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
           <b>Minor:</b> A minor release typically introduces new functionality APIs
           and/or provides bug-fixes (that might include code-generation). Changing
           to a new minor release therefore implies the following for existing nodes
           and applications:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Installing/Interoperability: existing nodes (with existing applications)
                don't require to be upgraded to the latest minor release as
                interoperability between minor-releases (of the same major-release)
                is guaranteed
              </li>
              <li>
                 Compiling: Applications that are to be ran on the new major release
                 shall be re-generated using the related OpenSplice DDS IDL preprocessor
                 followed by compilation of the generated code
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Maintenance:</b> A maintenance release contains execution-level bugfixes
            only and is made available on standard platforms. It is compatible with any
            previous version of OpenSplice DDS with the same major and minor version
            number. Portability (of existing applications) and interoperability (with
            existing nodes) is guaranteed implying that no recompilation is required and
            that the new maintenance release can be freely installed on any node in the
            distributed system. <b>WARNING: re-compilation may be required for
            maintenance version upgrades for applications built on
            top of the ISOC++ (v2) API's.</b> <i>This is due to the nature of the
            language in combination with how the API standard works. The
            OMG-delivered header files that must  be used in order to be
            compliant, contain many so-called templates. These templates have to
            be implemented in header files due to the nature of the C++ language.
            The down-side of the 'template approach' is that any change in the
            template code of our product, leads to a requirement for
            re-compilation of any applications built on top of them. This means
            if a change was made in one or more of the templates in the API,
            your applications will have to be recompiled.</i>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Patch:</b> A patch release contains specific bugfixes for specific platforms
            only and is compatible and interoperable with any previous version of OpenSplice
            DDS with the same major, minor and maintenance version number. A patch release
            is identified by a "pxx" version where xx is an incremental patch number after
            the maintenance release digit. Portability (of existing applications) and
            interoperability (with existing nodes) is guaranteed implying that no recompilation
            is required and that the new maintenance release can be selectively installed on
            relevant nodes (that require the patch) in the system.
            <b>WARNING: re-compilation may be required for
            patch version upgrades  for applications built on top of the ISOC++
            (v2) API's.</b> <i>This is due to the nature of the
