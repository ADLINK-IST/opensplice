This is the distribution of Log4C (last updated 13 Nov 2006)

* What is Log4C

   Log4C is a C library for flexible logging to files, syslog and other
   destinations. It is modeled after the Log for Java library
   (http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/), staying as close to their API as is
   reasonable.
   
   As well as the "doc" directory in the Log4C repository, see also here for
   more documentation on Log4c:
   
     http://log4c.sourceforge.net/

* Licensing

   Log4C libraries are released under the terms of the GNU Lesser
   General Public License (GNU LGPL). 

   You can find copies of the license in the file COPYING

* What you will need to compile Log4C on Unix systems

   perl 5.8+ (used by the automake tools)

   GNU make tools: automake 1.7+, autoconf 2.57+, m4 1.4+ and libtool 1.4+

   A Compiler, among those tested are:
   . gcc3 (on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4)
   . gcc4 (on HP-UX 11.11i, on Fedora Core 5)
   . Sun cc (versions 5.3 and 5.7 on Solaris 8 and higher, sparc and i386)
   . HPUX ansi C compiler (on HPUX v11.11i, pa-risc)
   . AIX xlc compiler

   If you request at compile time that the expat library be used to help parse
   the configuration file, then you will need the expat library available
   on the system.  If you do not use expat then pre-generated files from
   obsolete versions of flex and bison are used to do the parsing--this code
   is still supported for the moment but it is recommended to use expat.

   For information on compiling on Microsoft Windows see the README in the msvc6
   directory.

* Where to find ...

   GNU automake tools:
      http://gcc.gnu.org
      http://www.sunfreeware.com/ for pre-built Solaris packages
      http://hpux.connect.org.uk/ for re-built HP-UX depots

   gcc3 or gcc4
      http://gcc.gnu.org

* How to for library users who download a released tarball (eg.
  log4c-1.2.0.tar.gz):

  The Log4C package uses the GNU autotools compilation and installation
  framework.
  
  We recommend that you do not build in the source directories themselves;
  rather make a build directory into which the configure script will generate
  the Makefiles and build the library and binaries in there. This is better
  because it allows you to seperate the source from the binaries and also to
  mantain a compiled version of Log4C for different platforms--make a build
  directory for each of the platforms you support and run configure on each of
  your build machines.
  
  So, for example, you might create directories called build-fc5, build-rh3,
  build-Solaris10x86, build-hpuxi11 and so on for your various builds. These
  example commands below should compile Log4C on each of the supported
  platforms:
  
    $ tar -zxvf log4c-1.2.0.tar.gz
    $ mkdir build; cd build
    $ ../log4c-1.2.0/configure --prefix=/path/of/installation
    $ make
    $ make install

  To build the binary, source, developer and debuginfo RPMs for Linux:
    $ make rpm

  To enable compilation of the test programs for the library you would do this:
    $ ../log4c-1.2.0/configure --prefix=/path/of/installation --enable-test
   
  To enable the dcumentation generation
    $ ../log4c-1.2.0/configure --prefix=/path/of/installation --enable-doc
   
  To specify a compiler other than gcc at configure time you would do something
  like this:
    $ ../log4c-1.2.0/configure --prefix=/path/of/installation --enable-test \
      CC=/usr/SUNWspro/bin/cc

  To get started with the examples see the README in the examples source code
  directory and run them from the build directory as follows:
    $ cd examples
    $ ./application_1
    $ ./application_2

* How to for library developers ...
   
  When you check out Log4C from CVS (as opposed to downloading a released
  tarball) you will need to generate the configure script and so on. To do this
  run the bootstrap script. This script must be run in the source directories
  themselves:
   
    $ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@log4c.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/log4c login
    $ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@log4c.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/log4c co -P log4c
    $ cd log4c
    $ ./bootstrap

  To compile in extra tracing and messages and compile the doc you would do
  this from your build directory: 
    $ ../log4c/configure --prefix=/path/of/installation --enable-test \
        --enable-debug --enable-doc

   This will define the __SD_DEBUG__ variable at compile time. Note that you
   still need to define the SD_ERROR and SD_DEBUG envronment variables at run
   time to actually see the error/debug output.

   Type '../log4c/configure --help' for a list of all the configure
   options. Some of the options are generic autoconf options, while the Log4C
   specific options are prefixed with "LOG4C" in the help text.


Have Fun !!
