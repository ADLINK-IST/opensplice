This is the version of snappy-c that we build into networking.
It is based on the Andi Kleen port, commit id e42f0b5990, with the following changes:
- We build with -fPIC and no scatter-gather support.
- Implemented byte-swapping operations which aren't provided in RHEL4/5.
- Force 32-bit build if indicated by $PROC == x86
- Portability fixes for non-gcc and Solaris
