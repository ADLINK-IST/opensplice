 *  \brief Event management - condition variable
 *
 * A condition variable is a synchronisation service that allows threads
 * to suspend execution and relinquish the processors until some predicate
 * on shared data is satisfied.
 * The basic operations are:
 * - signal the condition
 * - wait for the condition
 *
 * Wait suspends the thread execution until another thread signals the condition.
 *
 * A condition variable must always be associated with a mutex, to avoid
 * a race condition where a thread prepares to wait on a condition variable and
 * another thread signals the condition just before the first thread actually
 * waits on it.
 *
 * A condition variable can have a system wide scope in which case it must be
 * defined in system shared memory. In that case it can be used to synchronize
 * processes and threads. A condition variable can also have a process wide
 * scope. The condition variable can then be defined in process shared memory
 * and can be used to synchronize threads.
 *
 * The implementation does not guarantee a process wide scope when requested.
 * This is only a performance optimization which can be ignored by the
 * implementation. The scope will then be system wide.
