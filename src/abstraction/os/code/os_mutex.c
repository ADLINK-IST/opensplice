 *  \brief Critical section management - mutual exclusion semaphore
 * 
 * A mutex is a mutual exclusion device, and is useful for protecting
 * shared data structures from concurrent modifications, and implementing
 * critical sections and monitors.
 *
 * A mutex has two possible states: unlocked (not owned by a thread),
 * and locked (owned by one thread). A mutex can never be owned by two
 * different threads simultaneously. A thread attempting to lock a mutex
 * that is already locked by another thread is suspended until the owning
 * thread releases the mutex first. A mutex may not be claimed recursively
 * by the same thread.
