 *  \brief Thread management - create threads
 *
 * A thread is a unit of execution. Threads can compete with each
 * other within the context of a process for the CPU (unbounded
 * threads, scheduling is on process scope) or threads can compete
 * with other processes or threads within the same or other processes
 * for the CPU (bounded threads, scheduling is on system scope).
 * A thread has its own stack, but shares the address space with
 * other threads within a process.
 *
 * \par Thread model on Solaris
 * Solaris supports bouded and unbounded threads, the OS layer
 * will only support bouded threads
 *
 * \par Thread model on Linux
 * Linux only supports bounded threads
