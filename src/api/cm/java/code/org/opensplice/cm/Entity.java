/**
 * Represents an entity in the Splice kernel. This class has been defined
 * abstract, because only descendants of this class may actually exist.
 *
 * The communication to Splice is done using a specific communication protocol.
 * To be able to communicate with Splice, the entity is serialized to and
 * deserialized from XML. XML represents the entity in a language independant
 * way and is therefore suitable to be transported over all kinds of
 * communication protocols.
 *
 * The model looks like:
