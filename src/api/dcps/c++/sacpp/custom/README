The makefile is already prepared to build the SACPP
- Go to the installation directory of your OpenSplice release.
- Source the release.com script of your OpenSplice release.
  In a bash shell this means entering the folloowing command 
  
  . ./release.com
  
- Go to the SACPP custom_lib directory:

  cd custom_lib
 
- Run make to rebuild the SACPP library:

  make -f Makefile.Build_DCPS_StandAlone_Cpp_Lib
  
- Once the library has successfuly been built it is copied into the
  $OSPL_HOME/lib directory.
  
  make realclean
  
  ... can be used to clean the previous library and all generated code.

  make clean

  ... only removes the geretaed object files.
