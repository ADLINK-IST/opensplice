     * This operation requests that the application will begin a
     * coherent set of modifications using DataWriter objects
     * attached to the Publisher. The coherent set will be
     * completed by a matching call to end.
     * A coherent set is a set of modifications that must be
     * propagated in such a way that they are interpreted at the
     * receivers' side as a consistent set of modifications; that
     * is, the receiver will only be able to access the data after
     * all the modifications in the set are available at the
     * receiver end. A connectivity change may occur in the middle
     * of a set of coherent changes; for example, the set of
     * partitions used by the Publisher or one of its Subscribers
     * may change, a late-joining DataReader may appear on the
     * network, or a communication failure may occur. In the event
     * that such a change prevents an entity from receiving the
     * entire set of coherent changes, that entity must behave as if
     * it had received none of the set. These calls can be
     * nested. In that case, the coherent set terminates only with
     * the last call to end. The support for
     * coherent changes enables a publishing application to change
     * the value of several data-instances that could belong to the
     * same or different topics and have those changes be seen
     * atomically by the readers. This is useful in cases where
     * the values are inter-related. For example, if there are two
     * data instances representing the altitude and velocity
     * vector of the same aircraft and both are changed, it may be
     * useful to communicate those values in such a way the reader
     * can see both together; otherwise, it may, for example,
     * erroneously interpret that the aircraft is on a collision course.
     *
     * The following constraints apply to the use of coherent sets:
     * - Ownership has no effect on the completeness of a transactions, i.e.
     *   it behaves as if ownership is applied after a transaction has
     *   become complete and before making samples visible.
     * - A time-based filter has no effect on the completeness of a transaction,
     *   i.e. it behaves as if messages are filtered out after a transaction
     *   has become complete and before making samples visible.
     * - Deleting writers or changing RxO QoS values that would break
     *   connectivity is not allowed and results in a PRECONDTION_NOT_MET
     * - A transaction that cannot be delivered because of insufficient
     *   resources i.e. keep all policy hitting the resource limits are
     *   currently discarded.
