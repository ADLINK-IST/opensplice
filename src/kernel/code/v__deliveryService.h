/** \file kernel/code/v__deliveryService.h
 *  \brief This file defines the interface of the Kernels Delivery Service.
 *
 * The Delivery Service implements a synchronous delivery protocol.
 * This Service implements a mechanism to send and receive delivery
 * acknoledgement.
 * When a synchronous DataReader receives a message from a synchronous
 * DataWriter it will acknowledge the message by calling the method
 * v_deliveryServiceAckMessage(). This method publishes a delivery message
 * via the builtin Delivery Topic DataWriter to acknowledeg the message.
 * The Delivery Service on the node of the DataWriter that has sent the message
 * will receive the delivery acknoledgement message and notify the DataWriter
 * that the sent message has been delivered.
