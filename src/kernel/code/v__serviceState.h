 * a subclass of <code>v_serviceState</code>. This can be used by services
 * to store their own state information in the kernel. Only the attributes 
 * defined in the <code>v_serviceState</code> class are initialised. It is
 * up to the service to initialise all attributes of the subclass.
 * <p>
 * Note: The given <code>type</code> is at runtime checked by assertion and
