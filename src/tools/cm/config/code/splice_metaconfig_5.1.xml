            <p>OpenSplice utilizes a shared-memory architecture where data is physically
            present only once on any machine and where smart administration still
            provides each subscriber with his own private view on this data. This
            allows a subscribers data cache to be perceived as an individual
            database that can content-filtered, queried, etc. (using the
            content-subscription profile as supported by OpenSplice). This
            shared-memory architecture results in an extremely low footprint,
            excellent scalability and optimal performance when compared to
            implementations where each reader/writer are communication-end points
            each with its own storage (i.e. historical data both at reader and
            writer) and where the data itself still has to be moved, even within
            the same platform.</p>

            <p>Shared-memory is not only used to interconnect all applications that
            reside within one computing node, but also for a configurable and
            extensible set of services. These services provide pluggable functionality
            such as networking (providing QoS-driven real-time networking based
            on multiple reliable multicast 'channels'), durability (providing
            fault-tolerant storage for both real-time state data as well as
            persistent settings) and a remote control & monitoring soap-service
            (providing remote web-based access using the SOAP protocol from the
            OpenSplice Tuner tool).</p>

            <p>Because of the pluggable architecture, the OpenSplice middleware
            can be easily configured on the fly by specifying which services to
            be used as well as specifying their optimal configuration for the
            application domain (networking parameters, durability levels, etc.).
            Typically, there are many nodes within a system.</p>

            <p>The OpenSplice middleware including its services can be configured
            by means of easy maintainable XML-file(s).</p>

            <p>The Domain service is responsible for creating and initialising a shared nodal administration(in shared memory)
            for a specific DDS Domain on a computing node. Without this administration, no other service or application is able
            to participate in a DDS Domain.</p>

            <p>Once the administration has been initialised, the Domain service starts the set of pluggable services. The
            lifecycle of the started services is under control of the Domain service, which means it will monitor the health
            of all started services, take corrective actions if needed and stop the services when it is terminated.</p>

            <p>When a shutdown of the OpenSplice Domain service is requested, it will react by announcing the shutdown using the
            shared administration. Applications will not be able to use DDS functionality anymore and services are requested
            to terminate elegantly. Once this has succeeded, the Domain service will destroy the shared administration and
            finally terminate itself.</p>

                    This element specifies the name of the instantiated DDS domain. In general, it is recommended to change
                    this name to a name that identifies the domain. If several different DDS domains are required to run
                    simultaneously, then they all need to have their own domain name.

                This (optional) element specifies the role of the instantiated domain. For dynamic discovery, this role will
                be used to define the communication scope of instantiated domains on other nodes in the system. The purpose
                of specifying roles within the system is to 'overlay' the underlying physical network with a node's scope-of-interest
                that allows to bound topology discovery effort and related overhead in large scale (WAN) systems.

                    <p>Every OpenSplice service including the Domain service itself has to announce its liveliness regularly.
                    This allows corrective actions to be taken when one of the services becomes non-responsive. This
                    element specifies the required interval. Decreasing the interval decreases the time in which
                    non-responsiveness of a service is detected, but leads to more processing. Increasing it has
                    the opposite effect.</p>

                        In case of a (temporary) high CPU load, the scheduling behaviour of the operating system might

                This may prevent graceful termination and thus leave applications
                that are still attached to the DDS domain in an undefined state.
                Consequently the '0' value should only be used when there is

                On platforms with a virtual memory architecture, the operating
                system decides when to swap memory pages from internal memory to disk.
                This results in execution delays for the corresponding code because it
                has to be paged back into main memory. The element <i>Locking</i> can be
                used to avoid such swapping for the Splice Deamon. The user needs the
                appropriate privileges from the underlying operating system to be able
                to use this option.

                        within shared memory. Services are allowed to continue allocating shared memory until less then
                        50% of the threshold value is available. It is strongly discouraged to configure a threshold
                        value of less then the default value, but for some embedded systems it might be needed as
                        only limited memory is available.

                    of the Networking service, (parts of) the historical data might not be

                    in historical data between them.</p>

                    <p>The Network element provides handles to fine-tune the behavior of the

                    <p>During startup and at runtime, the network topology can change

                    The Durability service is responsible for keeping its local cache
                    consistent with the other available Durability caches in the
                    system. To do this, it needs to exchange data to recover from
                    inconsistencies. The exchange of durable data to restore
                    consistency is called alignment. This element allows fine-tuning
                    alignment behaviour of the Durability service.

                        <p>When the Durability service detects an inconsistency with
                        another Durability service, it requests that service to align
                        it. The service that receives this request will restore
                        consistency by sending the requested information. In some
                        cases, the Durability service may receive alignment requests
                        from multiple Durability services for the same information
                        around the same moment in time. To reduce the processing and
                        networking load in that case, the Durability service is
                        capable of aligning multiple Durability services concurrently.</p>
                        <p>The RequestCombinePeriod has 2 child-elements: a setting
                        that is used when the current Durability Service is not yet
                        aligned with all others (<i>Initial</i>) and one for the period
                        after that (<i>Operational</i>). These values specify the maximum
                        amount of time the Durability service is allowed to wait with
                        alignment after an alignment request has been received.</p>
                        <p>Increasing the value will increase the amount of time in
                        which the Durability service restores from inconsistencies,
                        but will decrease the processing and network load in
                        case multiple Durability services need to resolve the
                        same data around the same time. Increasing the value
                        is useful in case OpenSplice is started at the same time
                        with more than two computing nodes.</p>

                        <p>This element determines how the durability service manages
                        the data that matches the namespace. Scalability of durable
                        data is an issue in large systems. Keeping all historical data
                        on each node may not be feasible. Often nodes are interested
                        in a small part of the total system data. They are driven
                        by both performance (boot time, memory usage, network load,
                        CPU load) and fault tolerance (the need for replicates).</p>
                        <p>The durability service provides the following
                        mechanisms to request and provide historical data:
                        <ul>
                        <li><b>Initial</b>: The durability service requests
                        historical data at startup and caches it locally. Historical
                        data will be available relatively fast for new local data
                        readers and the system is more fault-tolerant. However,
                        caching of historical data requires a relatively large
                        amount of resources and a long boot time.</li>
                        <li><b>Lazy</b>: The Durability service caches historical data
                        after local application interest arises for the first
                        time and a remote Durability service aligns the first
                        data reader. Historical data is available relatively slow
                        for the first data reader, but for every new data reader
                        it is relatively fast. The caching resources are only used
                        when local interest in the data arises, so it only requires
                        resources if there is actual local interest. However,
                        this method provides no fault-tolerance for the domain,
                        because the local Durability service is only partly a replica
                        and is not able to provide historical data to remote
                        Durability service and/or remote data readers.</li>
                        <li><b>On_Request</b>: The Durability service will not cache
                        historical data, but will align each separate DataReader
                        on a request basis (in the situation where it calls
                        wait_for_historical_data). Each new DataReader that
                        wants historical data therefore leads to a new alignment
                        action. This is a good setting to limit the amount of
                        resources used on the node, but will potentially lead to
                        more network traffic. This method provides no
                        fault-tolerance for the domain.</li>

            When communication endpoints are located on different computing nodes,
            the data produced using the local DDS service must be communicated to
            the remote DDS service and the other way around. The Networking service
            provides a bridge between the local DDS service and a network interface.
            Multiple Networking services can exist next to each other; each serving
            one (or more) physical network interface(s). The Networking service
            is responsible for forwarding data to the network and for receiving data
            from the network. It can be configured to distinguish multiple
            communication channels with different QoS policies assigned to be able
            to schedule sending and receival of specific messages to provide optimal
            performance for a specific application domain.

                of broadcast IP addresses. Any networking service that is started
                will read the network partition settings and, if applicable, join
                the required multicast groups. For every sample distributed by the
                networking service, both its partition and topic name will be
                inspected. In combination with a set of network partition mapping rules,
                the service will determine to which network partition the sample is
                written. The mapping rules are configurable as well.</p>
                <p>Using
                networking configuration, nodes can be disconnected from any
                networking partition. If a node is connected via a low speed
                interface, it is not capable of receiving high volume data. If
                the DCPS partitioning is designed carefully, high volume data is
                published into a specific partition, which on its turn is mapped
                onto a specific networking partition, which on its turn is only
                connected to those nodes that are capable of handling high volume data.</p>

                        The CipherKey attribute is used to define the secret key required by the declared
						cipher. The value can be a URI referencing an external file containing the secret key,
						or the secret key can be defined in-place directly as a string value. The key must be
						defined as a hexadecimal string, each character representing 4 bits of the key, for
						example. 1ABC represents the 16 bit key 0001 1010 1011 1100. The key must
						not follow a well-known pattern and must match exactly the key length required by
						the chosen cipher. In case of malformed cipher-keys, the security profile in question
						will be marked as invalid. Moreover, each network partition referring to the invalid
						Security Profile will not be operational and thus traffic will be blocked to prevent
						information leaks.
						As all OpenSplice applications require read access to the XML configuration file,
						for security reasons it is recommended to store the secret key in an external file in
						the file system, referenced by the URI in the configuration file. The file must be
						protected against read and write access from other users on the host. Verify that
						access rights are not given to any other user or group on the host.

						Alternatively, storing the secret key in-place in the XML configuration file will give
						read/write access to all DDS applications joining the same OpenSplice node.
						Because of this, the ‘in-place’ method is strongly discouraged.

                       CRCs are specifically designed to protect against common types of errors on communication channels.
                       When enabled the integrity of delivered network packets from one DDS process to another is assured.

                       In order to protect OpenSplice network packets from malicious attack the CrcCheck(cyclic redundancy check) configuration item has been added.
                       CRCs are specifically designed to protect against common types of errors on communication channels.
                       When enabled the integrity of delivered network packets from one DDS process to another is assured.
                       There is a small performance cost using this feature due to the addtional overhead of carrying out the crc calculation.

                       When the sending side is enabled the network packet will contain a valid crc field.

                   local node, except volatile best-effort data, is

                   that existing readers on remote nodes can get the
                   data even though discovering them takes some time.</p>

                   <p>Once the system is stable, the DDSI2 service keeps
                   track of the existence of remote readers whether or
                   not matching writers exist locally, avoiding this
                   discovery delay, and thereby ensuring this is
                   merely a node startup issue.</p>

                     but currently of little value because it adheres
                     even to what will most likely turn out to be
                     editing errors in the DDSI standard.  Arguably, as
                     long as no errata have been published it is the
                     current text that is in effect, and that is what
                     pedantic currently does.</li>

                   <li><b>strict</b> takes a slightly less strict view of the
                     standard than pedantic: it follows the established
                     behaviour where the standard is obviously in error.</li>

                   <li><b>lax</b> simply tries to provide the smoothest possible
                     interoperability, anticipating future revisions of

                    DBMSConnect service itself should not trigger new updates

                    <p>In replication mode, the DBMS-connect service ignores

                    DBMSConnect Service is considered to be of DBMSConnect
                    origin and therefore ignored). That way, replication of

                        <p>When replicating databases through DDS, the <i>NameSpace</i>
                        elements in the <i>DbmsToDds</i> and <i>DdsToDbms</i> elements
                        map a Table and Topic circularly. To prevent data-modifications
                        from continuously cascading, modifications made by the
                        service itself should not trigger new updates in the
                        DBMS nor in the DDS.</p>
                        <p>To distinguish between DBMS updates coming from an
                        application and DBMS updates coming from DDS, an extra
                        database user (the replication user) has to be introduced
                        that differs from the application users. That way,
                        replication of changes that were copied from DDS to Dbms
                        back into DDS is avoided. The replication_user attribute
                        specifies the user name of that replication user. An empty
                        string (default value) indicates that there is no separate
                        replication user.</p>
                        <p><b>WARNING</b>: This setting does not avoid replication
                        of changes that were copied from Dbms to DDS back into Dbms.
                        For that purpose, the <i>replication_mode</i> attribute of
                        the <i>DssToDbms</i> or <i>DssToDbms/NameSpace</i> elements
                        should be set appropriately as well!</p>
