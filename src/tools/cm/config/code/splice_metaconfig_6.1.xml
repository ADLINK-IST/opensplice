            <p>OpenSplice DDS is highly configurable, even allowing the architecture of the
            DDS middleware to be chosen by the user at deployment time. OpenSplice DDS can
            be configured to run using a <b>shared memory</b> architecture, where both the
            DDS related administration (including the optional pluggable services) and DDS
            applications interface directly with shared memory. Alternatively, OpenSplice
            DDS also supports a <b>single process</b> architecture, where one or more DDS
            applications, together with the OpenSplice administration and services, can all be
            grouped into a single operating system process. Both deployment modes support a
            configurable and extensible set of services, providing functionality such as:</p>
            <p>networking - providing QoS-driven real-time networking based on multiple
                reliable multicast 'channels'</p>
            <p>durability - providing fault-tolerant storage for both real-time state data as well as
              persistent settings</p>
            <p>remote control and monitoring SOAP service - providing remote web-based
              access using the SOAP protocol from the OpenSplice Tuner tool</p>
            <p>dbms service - providing a connection between the real-time and the enterprise
              domain by bridging data from DDS to DBMS and vice versa</p>
            <p>Because of the pluggable architecture, the OpenSplice middleware
            can be easily configured on the fly by specifying which services to
            be used as well as specifying their optimal configuration for the
            application domain (networking parameters, durability levels, etc.).
            Typically, there are many nodes within a system.</p>
            <p>The OpenSplice middleware including its services can be configured
            by means of easy maintainable XML-file(s).</p>

            <p>The Domain service is responsible for creating and initialising the DDS database which is used by the
            administration to manage a specific DDS Domain on a computing node. Without this administration, no other
            service or application is able to participate in a DDS Domain.</p>
            <p>Once the administration has been initialised, the Domain service starts the set of pluggable services. The
            lifecycle of the started services is under control of the Domain service, which means it will monitor the health
            of all started services, take corrective actions if needed and stop the services when it is terminated.</p>

            <p>When a shutdown of the OpenSplice Domain service is requested, it will react by announcing the shutdown using the
            DDS administration. Applications will not be able to use DDS functionality anymore and services are requested
            to terminate elegantly. Once this has succeeded, the Domain service will destroy the administration and
            finally terminate itself.</p>

                    Within a system and depending on the hosted application a Domain Service can

                      OpenSplice services and applications are intended to be all deployed within the
                      same process, known in OpenSplice as a single process.</p>
                    <p>Please note that the choice to use the single process deployment also implies
                      the use of heap memory for the OpenSplice database management instead of shared
                      memory that would be used otherwise. If no database size or size 0 is configured
                      the heap memory is limited by the Operating System, so the Database element under
                      Domain does not take effect when SingleProcess has a value of True.
                      If the database size is configured with a value, a database will be allocated on
                      heap with that size and the domain service will use it's own memory manager to
                      manage that memory</p>
                    <p>There are two ways in which to deploy an OpenSplice DDS application as a
                      single process:</p>
                    <p><b>Single Process Application</b> : The user starts an application as a
                      new process. In this case, the DDS create_participant operation will
                      implicitly start the OpenSplice Domain Service as a thread in the existing
                      application process. The OpenSplice Domain Service will then also implicitly
                      start all services specified in the configuration as threads within the same
                      process.
                    <p><b>Single Process Application Cluster</b> : This provides the option to
                      co-locate multiple DDS applications into a single process. This can be done
                      by creating application libraries rather than application executables that
                      can be linked into the single process in a similar way to how the DDS
                      middleware services are linked into the single process. The applications
                      that are created as libraries must be described using the Application
                      configuration attribute. These are started as threads within the existing
                      process by the Domain Service after all the DDS services that are specified
                      have been started as threads.</p>
                    <p>Please note that the Application elements specified under Domain will only
                      take effect when this SingleProcess attribute has a value
                      of true.</p>

                 The Kernel Manager monitors Builtin Topic on status changes of DataWriters and
                 inconsistencies between Topics and QoS policies, and it will notify all participants
                 interested in any of these events, i.e. it updates status fields and wakeup blocking
                 waitset and listener threads.
                 Controlling the scheduling behaviour of the Kernel Manager will therefore infuence
                 the reactivity on detecting events, but it will not infuence the event handling itself as
                 this is the responsibility of the participants waitset or listener thread.
                 Note that the Kernel Manager has no or limited value when Builtin Topics are
                 disabled.

                    This element specifies the maximum size of the memory segment for maintaining
                    the nodal administration. The memory management behaviour depends on the deployment mode
                    (federated vs single-process, driven by the //OpenSplice/Domain/SingleProcess element)
                    and the size configured within this element:
                    <ul>
                    <li> <b>Single process mode</b> In this mode the database is managed on heap.
                                If the size is set to zero, the heap is managed by the operating system memory
                                manager and limited to the operating system limit. If a non-zero size is
                                configured, the database is still allocated on heap, but the domain service
                                pre-allocates the entire size at once and will use its own memory manager
                                to manage this memory segment. The default value in this mode is 0 bytes.</li>
                    <li> <b>Federated mode</b> In this mode, the database is managed in shared memory segment
                                and the domain service will use its own memory manager to manage the
                                shared memory segment. The default value in this mode is 10 Mbytes.</li></ul>
                    Change this value if your system requires more memory than the default. Please note
                    that the operating system should be configured support the requested size.
                    On most platforms you need 'root' privileges to set large sizes.
                    The human-readable option lets the user postfix the value with
                    K(ilobyte), M(egabyte) or G(igabtye). For example, 10M results in 10485760 bytes.

          This attribute specifies the name of the function to be called to pass report data to
          the report plugin. The symbol_name is required; if it is not specified or cannot be
          resolved, an error message will be generated and the service will not attempt to
          resolve other symbol_names for the report plugin.
          The function is invoked slightly differently for applications using the DDS API and
          OpenSplice services. OpenSplice services invoke the function once for every report.
          For applications using the DDS API the function is invoked once per API call, in
          which case the XML is extended by one or more DETAIL elements.
          The implementation of this function must have the following signature:
          <p>int symbol_name (void *context, const char *report)</p>
          The result value is used to return the status of the call. If it is 0 then the operation
          was successful. If it is not 0 then there was an error and details of the error and the
          result value are reported to the OpenSplice DDS default report service.
          The context parameter is a reference to the plugin-specific data retrieved from the
          initialize operation.
          The report parameter is an XML string representation of the report data.
          <p>Below is an example of the mapping that the XML string representation will use
          when invoked by a service:
          <ul>

              <p>There are two ways for a late joining reader to retrieve historical
              data as a result of calling <tt>wait_for_historical_data()</tt> or
              <tt>DDS_wait_for_historical_data()</tt>.
              <ul>
                <li>The first way is to configure a local durability service
                    that is responsible for the alignment of historical data (see
                    //OpenSplice/DurabilityService). In this case the local durability
                    service will provide historical data to interested readers
                    on the local federations.</li>
                <li>The second way is NOT to run a local durability service, but
                    to request data from a durability service on a remote federation
                    using the client-durability feature. This makes sense in environments
                    where running a full-fledged durability service is not possible or
                    unwanted, e.g., due to resource limitations.</li>
              </ul>
              </p>
              <p>The element //OpenSplice/Domain/DurablePolicies specifies how
              historical data that is retrieved from a remote durability federation
              using the client-durability feature is handled locally. More specifically,
              this element allows the user to indicate whether historical data that
              is requested by a late joining reader using the client-durability feature
              will be made available to the requesting reader only, or to all readers in the
              federation. The behaviour can be specified per partition/topic combination
              in the //OpenSplice/Domain/DurablePolicies/Policy elements.</p>
              <p>In most situations it is sufficient to either configure a local durability
              service to acquire historical data, or to use the client-durability feature,
              but not both. However, it is not forbidden to use both methods concurrently.
              In that case it is advised to configure the system in such a way that historical
              data for a particular partition/topic combination is either provided using
              method 1 or 2. In the event that historical data for the same partition/topic
              combination can be requested via both methods, methods 1 will be used.</p>

                    <p>Applications need to be able to gain access to historical data in a system.
                    When the local DDS service gets connected to a remote DDS service by means

                    and exchange historical data with them to keep and/or restore consistency
                    in historical data between them.</p>

                    <p>The Network element provides handles to fine-tune the behavior of the

                    <p>During startup and at runtime, the network topology can change

                    need to keep data consistency in that environment. To detect newly

                On startup the Durability Service needs to determine, for each namespace, if it has
                to align with other Durability Services in the system or if it has to load the initial
                state from disk (load persistent data). For this the Durability Service will publish a
                request for information and wait for the specified initial discovery period for all
                Durability services to respond. The Durability Service will load the persistent data
                from disk if no response is received within the specified initial discovery period.
                This initial discovery period should be configured greater than the worst case
                expected discovery time which is related to underlying hardware, type of network,
                network configuration, and expected load. If the initial discovery period is too short
                the Durability Service may conclude that there is no running system and load the
                data from disk, which will result in conflicting states ('split-brain syndrome') i.e.
                two separate systems.
                The Durabiltiy Service will wait for at least the full initial discovery period before it
                can continue and become operational, so for fast startup times it is important to keep
                the initial discovery period as small as possible.
                <p>.The metaphoric term 'split-brain syndrome' is sometimes used to highlight the results of
                a temporary outage of communications between two parts of a system. In such a
                situation, the states of the disconnected parts evolve separately and become
                incompatible, so that by the time communication is restored the system has become
                'schizophrenic'.</p>

                        <p>When the Durability service detects an inconsistency with
                        another Durability service, it requests that service to align
                        it. The service that receives this request will restore
                        consistency by sending the requested information. In some
                        cases, the Durability service may receive alignment requests
                        from multiple Durability services for the same information
                        around the same moment in time. To reduce the processing and
                        networking load in that case, the Durability service is
                        capable of aligning multiple Durability services concurrently.</p>
                        <p>The RequestCombinePeriod has 2 child-elements: a setting
                        that is used when the current Durability Service is not yet
                        aligned with all others (<i>Initial</i>) and one for the period
                        after that (<i>Operational</i>). These values specify the maximum
                        amount of time the Durability service is allowed to wait with
                        alignment after an alignment request has been received.</p>
                        <p>Increasing the value will increase the amount of time in
                        which the Durability service restores from inconsistencies,
                        but will decrease the processing and network load in
                        case multiple Durability services need to resolve the
                        same data around the same time. Increasing the value
                        is useful in case OpenSplice is started at the same time
                        with more than two computing nodes.</p>

                 When all Durability Services in the domain have configured their aligner element
                 as false , none of them is able
                 to act as an aligner for newly-started Durability Services. Therefore late-joining
                 Durability Services will not be able to obtain historical data that is available in the
                 domain.
                 This element specifies the period (in seconds) to wait until an aligner becomes
                 available in the domain. If an aligner does not become available within the period
                 specified by this element, the entire federation will terminate and return with error
                 code 1 (recoverable error).
                 Currently only values between 0.0 and 1.0 are supported, and all non-zero values
                 are interpreted as infinite (so basically the time-out is currently either zero or
                 infinite). The default is 1.0. Note that when the element aligner
                 is set to true the current Durability Service is able to act as aligner for
                 other Durability Services with respect to the specified namespace and the federation
                 will not terminate.

                    MMF (memory mapped file) StoreMode.
                    Please also note that although technically the maximum valid value for this element
                    is maxInt, the operating system may impose a lower limit, to prevent 'runaway'

                       <br>If true, the implementation will do aggressive checking of the data it is

                       unforeseen ramifications: for example, a corruption of one database entry may
                       cause a large number of entries to become unreadable or for the entire database
                       to become unopenable.

                       the same time, so you may wish to adjust this parameter to control memory
                       usage. Also, a larger write buffer will result in a longer recovery time the next
                       time the database is opened.

                       increase this if your database has a large working set (budget one open file per

                       <br>Approximate size of user data packed per block. Note that the block size
                       specified here corresponds to uncompressed data. The actual size of the unit
                       read from disk may be smaller if compression is enabled. This parameter can be

             When a durability service wants to fulfill a particular role for some of the
             namespaces in a domain, it must have some way of deducing the desired behavior
             for those when encountered. For static, small-scale systems this can easily be solved
             by statically configurating this role-behavior for all relevant namespaces for each
             durability service in the domain.
             In dynamic, large scale environments, the updating and maintaining of
             configurations for each durability service when new namespaces enter the domain
             can become quite cumbersome. Dynamic namespaces offer a solution for this
             problem.
             Instead of specifying each namespace seperately, dynamic namespaces introduce
             the concept of namespace policies. A policy defines a generic role for the durability
             service, together with a namespace expression. This expression can contain
             wildcards, and is used to match against each namespace the durability service
             encounters in a domain. The first policy with a matching expression is then applied
             to the new namespace.
             Specifying policies
             Policies are specified in a fall-through manner, which means that the first (top)
             policy to match a namespace is applied. Policies specify a range of options for
             namespaces, which tell the durability service how to handle the data.
             The following items can be configured:
             * Durability
             * Alignee
             * Aligner
             In the dynamic namespace configuration, the NameSpace element (a child of the
             NameSpaces element) only supports a name attribute, which is mandatory. This
             name will be used to match against policies.

                    A namespace describes a dependency between data in two or

                    dependency specifies that the data within one of the
                    partitions has no right to exist separately from the data in
                    the other partition(s). Namespaces determine which data must
                    be managed by the Durability service. Data that does not
                    match any of the namespaces, is ignored by the Durability service.

                <p>This element determines how the durability service manages
                the data that matches the namespace. Scalability of durable
                data is an issue in large systems. Keeping all historical data
                on each node may not be feasible. Often nodes are interested
                in a small part of the total system data. They are driven
                by both performance (boot time, memory usage, network load,
                CPU load) and fault tolerance (the need for replicates).</p>
                <p>The durability service provides the following
                mechanisms to request and provide historical data:
                <ul>
                <li><b>Initial_And_Aligner</b>: The durability service requests
                historical data at startup and caches it locally. Historical
                data will be available relatively fast for new local data
                readers and the system is more fault-tolerant. However,
                caching of historical data requires a relatively large
                amount of resources and a long boot time. The Durability
                service will also provide historical data to other
                Durability services on a request basis.</li>
                <li><b>Initial</b>: The same as Initial_And_Aligner, except the
                Durability service will not provide other Durability services
                with historical data. This is useful when applications
                on the current node need all the processing and network
                bandwidth and dynamic interference is not allowed.</li>
                <li><b>Lazy</b>: The Durability service caches historical data
                after local application interest arises for the first
                time and a remote Durability service aligns the first
                data reader. Historical data is available relatively slow
                for the first data reader, but for every new data reader
                it is relatively fast. The caching resources are only used
                when local interest in the data arises, so it only requires
                resources if there is actual local interest. However,
                this method provides no fault-tolerance for the domain,
                because the local Durability service is only partly a replica
                and is not able to provide historical data to remote
                Durability service and/or remote data readers.</li>
                <li><b>On_Request</b>: The Durability service will not cache
                historical data, but will align each separate DataReader
                on a request basis (in the situation where it calls
                wait_for_historical_data). Each new DataReader that
                wants historical data therefore leads to a new alignment
                action. This is a good setting to limit the amount of
                resources used on the node, but will potentially lead to
                more network traffic. This method provides no
                fault-tolerance for the domain.</li>

                    A namespace describes a dependency between data in two or

                    dependency specifies that the data within one of the
                    partitions has no right to exist separately from the data in
                    the other partition(s). Namespaces determine which data must
                    be managed by the Durability service. Data that does not
                    match any of the namespaces, is ignored by the Durability service.

                    A template specifies behaviour for a namespace. It
                    matches a namespace name with an expression that may contain
                    wildcards, thereby allowing dynamic configuration for

                    important, as the first matching template
                    will be the one that is selected for a namespace.

               The scope attribute describes for which scope the merge policy is valid. The scope
               is a role-expression in which wildcards ('*' and '?') are allowed. Roles are matched

               When a role doesn't match any policy, 'Ignore' is assumed. The order of

                This element specifies whether or not the durability service should compare its
                current data set with the data set of its aligner before applying the merge policy.
                If this option is enabled the aligner will align its data sets only in case there is
                a difference between his data sets and the data sets of this durability service.
                By default this option is NOT enabled, so data is always aligned even if there is no
                difference between data sets.<br/><br/>
                This option applies to all merge policies except for the IGNORE and DELETE merge
                policy.<br/><br/>
                <b>NOTE</b> Enabling this option may lead to less alignment data at the expense of
                processing power required to calculate hashes to compare the data sets. It is recommended
                to enable this option only for large data sets that do not change often. If this option is
                enabled for data sets that change often then chances of set equality are small, while the
                penalty to calculate hashes still exists.

                    Filters are expressions that are applied when historical

                    filters the amount of alignment data between durability

                    Different filters can be specified for different partition-topic

                    In case a node that has retrieved a subset of historical data
                    using filters becomes the aligner to other nodes at some
                    point in time, then only this subset will be aligned to the other

                      This attribute specifies the expression that is used for filtering.
                      The expression is a string that is used as-is without any parameters.
                      The filter expression is essentially the where-clauses of an sql expression.
                      When data is requested for matching partition-topics only the data
                      that matches the filter expression will be aligned. The
                      content attribute defaults to the empty string, which means that
                      no filter is applied at all.<br/><br/>
                      The following escape sequence can be used in expressions: &amp;lt;
                      (less than), &amp;gt; (greater than), &amp;quot; (double quote)
                      &amp;apos; (apostrophe) and &amp;amp; (ampersand).<br/><br/>
                      Examples of expressions are:
                      <ul>
                        <li>x=1 or x=2</li>
                        <li>(id&amp;lt;10) and (name=&quot;test&quot;)</li>
                      </ul>
                      If an invalid filter expression is provided an error will be logged
                      in ospl-error.log.

                     validity of restoring lost connectivity with remote nodes.
                     Here 'lost connectivity' means a prolonged inability to communicate with a known
                     and still active remote node (typically because of network-issues)
                     that has resulted in such a node being declared 'dead' either by the topology-discovery or
                     lost-reliability being detected by a reliable channel's reactivity-checking mechanism.
                     If automatic reconnection is allowed, communication channels with the now-reachable-again node will be restored,
                     even though reliable data might have been lost during the disconnection period.

                <p>The OpenSplice Secure Networking service is capable of leveraging
                the network's multicast and routing capabilities. If some a-priori
                knowledge about the participating
                nodes and their topic and partition interest is available, then the
                secure networking services in the system can be explicitly instructed to use
                specific unicast or multicast addresses for its networking traffic.
                This is done by means of so-called network partitions</p>
                <p>A network partition is defined by one or more unicast, multicast
                of broadcast IP addresses. Any secure networking service that is started
                will read the network partition settings and, if applicable, join
                the required multicast groups. For every sample distributed by the
                secure networking service, both its partition and topic name will be
                inspected. In combination with a set of network partition mapping rules,
                the service will determine to which network partition the sample is
                written. The mapping rules are configurable as well.</p>
                <p>Using
                networking configuration, nodes can be disconnected from any
                networking partition. If a node is connected via a low speed
                interface, it is not capable of receiving high volume data. If
                the DCPS partitioning is designed carefully, high volume data is
                published into a specific partition, which on its turn is mapped
                onto a specific networking partition, which on its turn is only
                connected to those nodes that are capable of handling high volume data.</p>

                        This is a mandatory attribute. Depending on the declared cipher, the cipher key must
                        have a specific length, 128 bits, 192 bits, 256 bits or none at all. The following
                        case-insensitive values are supported by the current implementation:
                        <ul>
                            <li>aes128, implements AES cipher with 128 bit cipher-key (16 Bytes, 32 hexadecimal characters). This cipher will occupy 34 bytes of each UDP packet being sent.</li>
                            <li>aes192, implements the AES cipher with 192 bit cipher-key (24 Bytes, 48 hexadecimal characters). This cipher will occupy 34 bytes of each UDP packet being sent.</li>
                            <li>aes256, implements the AES cipher with 256 bit cipher-key (32 Bytes, 64 hexadecimal characters. This cipher will occupy 34 bytes of each UDP packet being sent.</li>
                            <li>blowfish, implements the Blowfish cipher with 128 bit cipher-key (16 Bytes, 32 hexadecimal characters). This cipher will occupy 26 bytes of each UDP packet being sent.</li>
                            <li>null, implements the NULL cipher. The only cipher that does not require a cipher-key. This cipher will occupy 4 bytes of each UDP packet being sent.</li>
                        </ul>
                        All ciphers except for the NULL cipher are combined with SHA1 to achieve data
                        integrity. Also, the rsa- prefix can be added to the ciphers. In this case, digital
                        signatures using RSA will be available.

                        The CipherKey attribute is used to define the secret key required by the declared
                        cipher. The value can be a URI referencing an external file containing the secret key,
                        or the secret key can be defined in-place directly as a string value. The key must be
                        defined as a hexadecimal string, each character representing 4 bits of the key, for
                        example. 1ABC represents the 16 bit key 0001 1010 1011 1100. The key must
                        not follow a well-known pattern and must match exactly the key length required by
                        the chosen cipher. In case of malformed cipher-keys, the security profile in question
                        will be marked as invalid. Moreover, each network partition referring to the invalid
                        Security Profile will not be operational and thus traffic will be blocked to prevent
                        information leaks.
                        As all OpenSplice applications require read access to the XML configuration file,
                        for security reasons it is recommended to store the secret key in an external file in
                        the file system, referenced by the URI in the configuration file. The file must be
                        protected against read and write access from other users on the host. Verify that
                        access rights are not given to any other user or group on the host.

                        Alternatively, storing the secret key in-place in the XML configuration file will give
                        read/write access to all DDS applications joining the same OpenSplice node.
                        Because of this, the 'in-place' method is strongly discouraged.

                        This element describes the DiffServ setting the channel will apply to the networking messages.
                        This parameter determines the value of the  diffserv field of the IP version 4 packets send
                        on this channel which allows QoS setting to be applied to the network traffic send on this channel.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Windows platform support for setting the diffserv field is dependent on the OS version.
                        For Windows versions XP SP2 and 2003 to use the diffserv field the following parameter should
                        be added to the register:
                        <br/><br/>
                        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\TcpIp\Parameters\DisableUserTOSSetting
                        <br/><br/>
                        The type of this parameter is a DWORD and it's value should be set to 0 to allow setting of the diffserv field.
                        <br/><br/>
                        For Windows version 7 or higher a new API (qWAVE) has been introduced For these platforms the specified
                        diffserv value is mapped to one of the support traffic types. The mapping is as follows:
                        1-8 background traffic; 9-40 excellent traffic; 41-55 audio/video traffic; 56 voice traffic; 57-63 control traffic.
                        When OpenSplice is run without Administrative priveleges then only the diffserv value of 0, 8, 40 or 56 is allowed.

                            protocol. This protocol ensures that a consistent or aligned data-set is received by all
                            alive (receiving) nodes, even though some nodes might not have received some
                            packets at the moment a sending node disappears (for whatever reason). The
                            protocol implies that each node retains sufficient received data so that it can be
                            (re-)distributed if a publishing node disappears before all receiving nodes are
                            "up-to-date". When the PacketRetentionPeriod element is set to 0 (the default
                            value), the alignment amongst receiving nodes will not occur. To activate the
                            extended realibility protocol, this setting must be configured to a time period that
                            exceeds the worst-case death-detection time as configured for the discovery
                            protocol of the set of distributed networking services in the system.

                        This parameter determines the value of the  diffserv field of the IP version 4 packets send
                        on this channel which allows QoS setting to be applied to the network traffic send on this channel.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Windows platform support for setting the diffserv field is dependent on the OS version.
                        For Windows versions XP SP2 and 2003 to use the diffserv field the following parameter should
                        be added to the register:
                        <br/><br/>
                        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\TcpIp\Parameters\DisableUserTOSSetting
                        <br/><br/>
                        The type of this parameter is a DWORD and it's value should be set to 0 to allow setting of the diffserv field.
                        <br/><br/>
                        For Windows version 7 or higher a new API (qWAVE) has been introduced For these platforms the specified
                        diffserv value is mapped to one of the support traffic types. The mapping is as follows:
                        1-8 background traffic; 9-40 excellent traffic; 41-55 audio/video traffic; 56 voice traffic; 57-63 control traffic.
                        When OpenSplice is run without Administrative priveleges then only the diffserv value of 0, 8, 40 or 56 is allowed.

The Network Service provides a bridge between the local DDS service and a
network interface.
<p>The OpenSplice NetworkService supports both Internet Protocol
Versions 4 and 6 (IPv4 & IPv6) where possible. Please refer to the Release Notes
(Known Issues section) to see if the IPv6 capability is present on your operating
system.</p>
<p>Note that each service instance will only communicate using one of these protocols.
It is an error to specify IPv6 ('colon-separated hexadecimal') and IPv4 ('dotted
decimal') addresses in the same NetworkService configuration.</p>
Multiple Network Services can exist next to each other, each serving one physical
network interface.
Please refer to Applications which operate in multiple domains, for notes about
applications operating in multiple domains and interactions with the Network Service.
The Network Service is responsible for forwarding data to the network and for
receiving data from the network. It can be configured to distinguish multiple
communication channels with different QoS policies assigned to be able to schedule
sending and receival of specific messages to provide optimal performance for a
specific application domain.
The Network Service is selected by using the following configuration element to the
Domain section of the configuration file (Element Application).
<i><br><Service name="networking">
<br><Command>networking</Command>
<br></Service></i>
<br>The network configuration expects a root element named
OpenSplice/NetworkService. Within this root element, the Network Service
will look for several child-elements. Each of these is listed and explained.

                the required multicast groups. For every sample distributed by the

                <p>Using
                networking configuration, nodes can be disconnected from any
                networking partition. If a node is connected via a low speed
                interface, it is not capable of receiving high volume data. If
                the DCPS partitioning is designed carefully, high volume data is
                published into a specific partition, which on its turn is mapped
                onto a specific networking partition, which on its turn is only
                connected to those nodes that are capable of handling high volume data.</p>

                        of the different channels divide the priority range
                        into intervals. Within a channel, messages are sorted in
                        order of priority.

                        This element describes the DiffServ setting the channel will apply to the networking messages.
                        This parameter determines the value of the  diffserv field of the IP version 4 packets send
                        on this channel which allows QoS setting to be applied to the network traffic send on this channel.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Windows platform support for setting the diffserv field is dependent on the OS version.
                        For Windows versions XP SP2 and 2003 to use the diffserv field the following parameter should
                        be added to the register:
                        <br/><br/>
                        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\TcpIp\Parameters\DisableUserTOSSetting
                        <br/><br/>
                        The type of this parameter is a DWORD and it's value should be set to 0 to allow setting of the diffserv field.
                        <br/><br/>
                        For Windows version 7 or higher a new API (qWAVE) has been introduced For these platforms the specified
                        diffserv value is mapped to one of the support traffic types. The mapping is as follows:
                        1-8 background traffic; 9-40 excellent traffic; 41-55 audio/video traffic; 56 voice traffic; 57-63 control traffic.
                        When OpenSplice is run without Administrative priveleges then only the diffserv value of 0, 8, 40 or 56 is allowed.

This element controls various parameters of the Network Services Discovery
mechanism.
Discovery reduces the Network Service configuration and minimizes network
traffic. Without Discovery, data is always sent to the network and all Networking
Services need to configure the addresses (This can be multicast addresses and/or
uni-cast addresses, especially in an uni-cast environment with many nodes the
configuration of the Network Service's lists can be cumbersome.)
of all Network Services they need to
communicate with. With Discovery, data is only sent to where interest exists and
connectivity is discovered based on a minimum configuration (Only a subset of
addresses of nodes are initially specified, these nodes are assumed to be
available as a discovery source, all nodes will make themselves known to these discovery
nodes and thereby making its existence and address available for all other nodes) (see Element ProbeList).
Discovery is based on a heartbeat mechanism to advertize the service's availability.
The Network Service starts by announcing its existence by sending heartbeats to the
Global Partition (The Global Partition contains all the addresses that the Network Service communicate
with) which is initially filled with the addresses specified in the
ProbeList; remote Network Services receiving the heartbeat will start sending
heartbeats in return. All Network Services that discover new heartbeats will
automatically request address information that match their Scope (see Attribute Scope)
from the Network Service sending the
heartbeat, and add the retrieved address information to their Global Partition.
Currently only uni-cast addresses are exchanged. Addresses are removed from the
Global Partition when a remote Network Service stops and heartbeats are no longer
received.

                       In order to protect OpenSplice network packets from malicious attack the CrcCheck(cyclic redundancy check) configuration item has been added.
                       CRCs are specifically designed to protect against common types of errors on communication channels.
                       When enabled the integrity of delivered network packets from one DDS process to another is assured.
                       There is a small performance cost using this feature due to the addtional overhead of carrying out the crc calculation.

                        on this channel which allows QoS setting to be applied to the network traffic send on this channel.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Windows platform support for setting the diffserv field is dependent on the OS version.
                        For Windows versions XP SP2 and 2003 to use the diffserv field the following parameter should
                        be added to the register:
                        <br/><br/>
                        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\TcpIp\Parameters\DisableUserTOSSetting
                        <br/><br/>
                        The type of this parameter is a DWORD and it's value should be set to 0 to allow setting of the diffserv field.
                        <br/><br/>
                        For Windows version 7 or higher a new API (qWAVE) has been introduced For these platforms the specified
                        diffserv value is mapped to one of the support traffic types. The mapping is as follows:
                        1-8 background traffic; 9-40 excellent traffic; 41-55 audio/video traffic; 56 voice traffic; 57-63 control traffic.
                        When OpenSplice is run without Administrative priveleges then only the diffserv value of 0, 8, 40 or 56 is allowed.

The SafetyFactor is used to set a margin (< 1) on the expected heartbeat interval.
The actual interval at which the heartbeats are sent is the specified interval
multiplied by this factor, so the actual interval will be equal to or smaller than the
specified value. This can be used to avoid timing issues such as those caused by
typical scheduling or network latencies.

          <comment><![CDATA[
                   The reactivity of discovery depends on the heartbeat frequency, a higher heartbeat
                   frequency gives a faster reactivity but also imposes a higher network load, which is
                   not desirable. Ideally the heartbeat frequency must be kept as low as possible but
                   from a startup (and shutdown) perspective a high reactivity is often desired. So the
                   Network Service has the capability to send an additional salvo of heartbeats at
                   startup and shutdown at ten times the normal heartbeat speed to maximize reactivity
                   during these phases without requiring a continuous high heartbeat frequency. The
                   SalvoSize sets the number of messages to send during these phases.

                       In order to protect OpenSplice network packets from malicious attack the CrcCheck(cyclic redundancy check) configuration item has been added.
                       CRCs are specifically designed to protect against common types of errors on communication channels.
                       When enabled the integrity of delivered network packets from one DDS process to another is assured.
                       There is a small performance cost using this feature due to the addtional overhead of carrying out the crc calculation.

                       When the sending side is enabled the network packet will contain a valid crc field.

<p>This element describes the DiffServ setting the channel will apply to the networking messages. This parameter determines the value of the diffserv field of the IP version 4 packets sent on this channel which allows QoS setting to be applied to the network traffic send on this channel.<br/>
Windows platform support for setting the diffserv field is dependent on the OS version.<br/>
For Windows versions XP SP2 and 2003 to use the diffserv field the following parameter should be added to the register:<br/><br>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\TcpIp\Parameters\DisableUserTOSSetting<br/><br/>
The type of this parameter is a DWORD and its value should be set to 0 to allow setting of the diffserv field.<br/><br/>
For Windows version 7 or higher a new API (qWAVE) has been introduced. For these platforms the specified diffserv value is mapped to one of the support traffic types.
The mapping is as follows: 1-8 background traffic; 9-40 excellent traffic; 41-55 audio/video traffic; 56 voice traffic; 57-63 control traffic.
When an application is run without Administrative priveleges then only the diffserv value of 0, 8, 40 or 56 is allowed.</p>

<p>This element specifies the number of messages the network queue for this channel can contain. The OpenSplice kernel writes data to be transmitted to the network queue, and DDSI2E takes them from this queue. If this queue is full when an application tries to write a sample, the sample will be dropped or the writer suspended, depending on the QoS settings of the writer. OpenSplice and its services are optimised for a well-balanced system design, where the queue never becomes full.</p>

<p>The CipherKey attribute is used to define the secret key required by the cipher selected using the Cipher attribute. The value can be a URI referencing an external file containing the secret key, or the secret key can be defined in-place as a string value.</p>
<p>The key must be specified as a hexadecimal string with each character representing 4 bits of the key. E.g., 1ABC represents the 16-bit key 0001 1010 1011 1100. The key should not follow a well-known pattern and must exactly match the key length of the selected cipher.</p>
<p>A malformed key will cause the security profile to be marked as invalid, and disable all network partitions secured by the (invalid) security profile to prevent information leaks.</p>
<p>As all DDS applications require read access to the XML configuration file, for security reasons it is recommended to store the secret key in an external file in the file system, referenced by its URI. The file should be protected against read and write access from other users on the host.</p>

<ul><li><i>pedantic</i>: very strictly conform to the specification, ultimately for compliancy testing, but currently of little value because it adheres even to what will most likely turn out to be editing errors in the DDSI standard. Arguably, as long as no errata have been published it is the current text that is in effect, and that is what pedantic currently does.</li>
<li><i>strict</i>: a slightly less strict view of the standard than does pedantic: it follows the established behaviour where the standard is obviously in error.</li>
<li><i>lax</i>: attempt to provide the smoothest possible interoperability, anticipating future revisions of elements in the standard in areas that other implementations do not adhere to, even though there is no good reason not to.</li></ul>
<p>The default setting is "lax".</p>
