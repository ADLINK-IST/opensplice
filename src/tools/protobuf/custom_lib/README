REGENERATING OPENSPLICE GOOGLE PROTOCOL BUFFER PLUGIN
-----------------------------------------------------

By default the OpenSplice Google Protocol Buffer plugin is compiled for Google Protocol Buffers version 2.6.0
When another version of Google Protocol Buffers is needed a recompile of the plugin can be done for this version.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

It is assumed that the user will make sure the following preconditions are met:
- Maven is installed
- Java compiler is installed
- The to be used version of Google Protocol Buffers is installed
- the path is setup to include the preceding items
- PROTOBUF_HOME environment variable is set to the directory of the to be used version of Google Protocol Buffers.

------------------------------------------------------
For Posix platforms:

- Go to the installation directory of your OpenSplice release.
- Source the release.com script of your OpenSplice release.
  In a bash shell this means entering the following command

  . ./release.com

- Go to the custom_lib protocol buffer directory:

  cd custom_lib/protobuf

- Run the build script

  ./build

  $OSPL_HOME/jar directory.
