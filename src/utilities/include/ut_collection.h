/** \file ut_collection.h
 *  \brief This file implements collection type class.
 *
 * A collection represents a group of objects, known as its elements. Some 
 * collections allow duplicate elements and others do not. Some are ordered 
 * and others unordered. This interface provides an abstract constructor 
 * function in which a specific kind of collection is created. The constructor 
 * requires a pointer to a comparision function so the collection implementation 
 * is able to compare elements.
 * Collections instances are defined for specific elements type so all elements
 * must be of the same type. 
 * Collection types can be used within application-defined types to implement
 * navigational relations. Collections of objects implement a unidirectional 
 * 1-to-1 and 1-to-many relations.
 *
 * At this moment the following sub-types are provided:
 *
 *    ut_table : an indexed collection where objects are identified by a specific 
 *               key value. Each key value has only one occurence in the table.
 *
 * The following collection constructor method is provided:
 *
 *     ut_collection  ut_listNew      (ut_compareElementsFunc cmpFunc, c_voidp arg);
 *     ut_collection  ut_setNew       (ut_compareElementsFunc cmpFunc, c_voidp arg);
 *     ut_collection  ut_bagNew       (ut_compareElementsFunc cmpFunc, c_voidp arg);
 *     ut_collection  ut_tableNew     (ut_compareElementsFunc cmpFunc, c_voidp arg);
 * 
 * The following destructor method is provided:
 *     void      ut_collectionFree (ut_collection c, 
 *                                  ut_freeElementsFunc action, 
 *                                  c_voidp arg);
 *
 * The following generic collection methods are provided:
 *
 *     c_bool    ut_add      (ut_collection c, c_object o);
 *     c_object  ut_get      (ut_collection c, c_object o);
 *     c_object  ut_remove   (ut_collection c, c_object o);
 *     c_bool    ut_contains (ut_collection c, c_object o);
 *     c_long    ut_count    (ut_collection c);
 *     c_bool    ut_walk     (ut_collection c, c_action action, c_voidp arg);
 *
 * The following list specific (positional) methods are provided:
 *
 *     c_object     ut_getAt    (ut_list list, c_long index);
 *     c_object     ut_removeAt (ut_list list, c_long index);
 *
 * The following table specific methods are provided:
 * 
 *     c_bool       ut_put      (ut_table t, c_object key, c_object value);
 *
