## @defgroup dds1583_scenario1 DDS1583 - Durability merge policy scenario 1: Merging between two nodes in the same role
#
# \b Test \b ID: dds1583_scenario1
#
# \b Test \b Objectives: \n
# Verify a consistent state of nodes and data throughout the DDS network after a temporary network failure.
# A physical network failure between two nodes on the same subnet is simulated by blocking all incoming OpenSplice traffic on these nodes.
# During this period of disconnection, samples are published on one of the nodes. The network failure is then resolved by removing the OpenSplice traffic blocks.
# The test succeeds if the nodes are rediscovered, a single preferred aligner is negotiated by the durability services on the nodes,
# and the data published during the period of disconnection is replicated to the other node, such that both nodes have access to the same, complete, set of samples (scenario 1b).
# During a second period of disconnection, samples are published on both nodes. When the network failure is restored, both nodes will have to replicate their data to the other node, the test
# succeeds if both nodes have access to both sets of samples (scenario 1c).
#
# \b Prerequisites, \b assumptions, \b constraints
#
# \par \e Environment:
# Two hosts are used for this test. To simulate network failure between the nodes, each node is running a firewall that can be manipulated to allow,
# or disallow, incoming OpenSplice traffic from the other host. Three UDP ports are used by the nodes in this test: C1 (best-effort channel),
# C2 (reliable channel) and C3 (discovery). All three are to be closed, on both ends, to completely isolate a node from another node.
# Note: OpenSplice automatically selects an additional port for acknowledgement of traffic on the reliable channel.
#
# \par \e Invariant:
# Both participating hosts are running the OpenSplice daemon with networking and durability services enabled on the default domain.
# The topic 'TestTopic' (T1) is used for this test, created with default QoS settings with the following exceptions: durability is set to transient,
# reliability is set to reliable. Two sets of samples are used: S1 and S2. Both hosts are in the default role.
# Two variations of the test are run in this scenario, a one-way merge (scenario 1b) and a two-way merge (scenario 1c). In both cases, durability is configured for initial alignment
# of the default namespace. Networking is configured to allow reconnections.
# A merge policy is defined on both hosts to allow merging with other nodes in the default namespace and default role. Durability tracing is enabled with verbosity-level set to FINEST,
# the tracing log is verified to check the expected behaviour of the durability service.
#
# \par \e Node \e 1:
# Subscribed to T1, publisher of T1 samples set S1, on the default (built-in) partition.
# \par \e Node \e 2:
# Subscribed to T1, publisher of T1 samples set S2, on the default (built-in) partition.
#
# \b Test \b Procedure
#
# \b Step \b 1
# \par \e Action
# Start OpenSplice on both nodes and confirm both hosts have agreed on a single master node for the default namespace.
# \par \e Result
# Either Node1 is master of itself and Node2, or Node2 is master of itself and Node1.
#
# \b Step \b 2
# \par \e Action
# Disconnect the hosts by blocking incoming traffic on OpenSplice ports on Node1 for the IP address of Node2. Do the same on Node2 for the IP address of Node1
# \par \e Result
# The nodes are disconnected. The ospl-info.log on both hosts show messages about missed heartbeats from the other host, after which it is removed from the reliable networking protocol.
#
# \b Step \b 3
# \par \e Action
# Confirm both hosts are master of themselves.
# \par \e Result
# Both nodes have lost their only fellow thus are selected as a master of themselves.
#
# \b Step \b 4
# \par \e Action
# Create a DataWriter on Node2, write samples S2.
# \par \e Result
# The datawriter completes the write operation without errors.
#
# \b Step \b 5
# \par \e Action
# Restore communication between hosts by accepting incoming traffic on OpenSplice ports on Node1 for the IP address of Node2. Do the same on Node2 for the IP address of Node1 (reversing step 2)
# \par \e Result
# Communication is restored. Durability logging confirms the hosts are rediscovered and merge policy is applied due to a master conflict. Node1 merges with Node2, which contains samples S1 written in Step4.
#
# \b Step \b 6
# \par \e Action
# Confirm both hosts again agree on a single master for the default namespace (repeat Step1).
# \par \e Result
# Either Node1 is master of itself and Node2, or Node2 is master of itself and Node1.
#
# \b Step \b 7
# \par \e Action
# Create a DataReader on Node1, subscribing to T1 on the built-in partition. Wait 3 seconds for historical data and then take all samples.
# \par \e Result
# All samples in S2 are read.
#
# \b Step \b 8
# \par \e Action
# The previous steps verified a one-way merge. To verify a two-way merge:
# - During Step4, additionally write samples S1 on Node1.
# - During Step7, additionally read samples S1 on Node2.
# \par \e Result
# S1 and S2 are read on both Node1 and Node2.
#
# \b Step \b 9
# \par \e Action
# Stop OpenSplice and retrieve logfiles on both nodes.
# \par \e Result
# OpenSplice and services are properly stopped on all nodes.
