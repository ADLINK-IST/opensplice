## @defgroup dds1583_scenario2 DDS1583 - Durability merge policy scenario 2: Merging between three nodes in the same role
#
# \b Test \b ID: dds1583_scenario2
# 
# \b Test \b Objectives: \n
# Verify a consistent state of nodes and data throughout the DDS network after a temporary network failure.
# This test is similar to \ref dds1583_scenario1, except three nodes are active instead of two.
# During the network interruption, samples are published on all three nodes. The test succeeds if, after the network is restored,
# all samples are available on each of the three nodes.
#
# \b Prerequisites, \b assumptions, \b constraints
#
# \par \e Environment:
# Three hosts are used for this test. To simulate network failure between the nodes, each node is running a firewall that can be manipulated    
# to allow, or disallow, incoming OpenSplice traffic from a different host. Three UDP ports are used by the nodes in this test: C1 (best-effort channel),    
# C2 (reliable channel) and C3 (discovery). All three are to be closed, on both ends, to completely isolate a node from another node, while not affecting traffic
# Note: OpenSplice automatically selects an additional port for acknowledgement of traffic on the reliable channel.
#
# \par \e Invariant:
# All three participating hosts are running the OpenSplice daemon with networking and durability services enabled on the default domain.   
# The topic 'TestTopic' (T1) is used for this test, created with default QoS settings with the following exceptions: durability is set to transient,    
# reliability is set to reliable. Three sets of samples are used: S1, S2 and S3. All nodes are in the default role and are configured to merge data in the
# default namespace with other nodes in the default role.
# Other variations of this testcases exist (\ref dds1583_scenario3, \ref dds1583_scenario4) in which nodes are placed in different roles. 
# Networking is configured to allow reconnections. To be able to validate preferred aligner selection, durability tracing is enabled with verbosity-level set to FINEST.   
#    
# \par \e Node \e 1:    
# Subscribed to T1, publisher of T1 samples set S1, on the default (built-in) partition.    
# \par \e Node \e 2:      
# Subscribed to T1, publisher of T1 samples set S2, on the default (built-in) partition.
# \par \e Node \e 3:
# Subscribed to T1, publisher of T1 samples set S3, on the default (built-in) partition.
#
# \b Test \b Procedure
#
# \b Step \b 1
# \par \e Action
# Start the OpenSplice daemon, networking and durability services on all nodes and confirm a correct master selection
# \par \e Result
# Spliced, networking and durability started succesfully. All nodes are in the default role so agree on a single master node.
#
# \b Step \b 2
# \par \e Action
# Isolate Node1 from Node2 and Node3. To do so modify the firewall to drop traffic on C1, C2, C3:
# - On Node1, for the IP addresses of Node2 and Node3
# - On Node2, for the IP address of Node1
# - On Node3, for the IP address of Node1  
# \par \e Result
# Node1 is disconnected from Node2 and Node3. The ospl-info.log on Node1 confirms missed hearbeats from both other nodes, 
# after which they are from the reliable networking protocol. On Node2 and Node3 this also happens for Node1.
# Node2 and Node3 remain connected with each other.
#
# \b Step \b 3
# \par \e Action
# Create DataWriters on Node1, Node2 and Node3, write samples S1 on Node1, S2 on Node2, S3 on Node3.
# \par \e Result
# DataWriters on all three nodes complete the write operation without errors.
#
# \b Step \b 4
# \par \e Action
# Restore communication of Node1 with Node2 and Node3.
# To do so modify the firewall to allow traffic on C1, C2 and C3 in reverse of Step2.
# \par \e Result
# Node1 is reconnected with Node2 and Node3. The durability logging confirms the hosts are rediscovered and merge policies are applied due to a master conflict between Node1 and either Node2 or Node3, 
# depending on which one was master during the time Node1 was isolated.
#
# \b Step \b 5
# \par \e Action
# Create DataReaders on Node1, Node2 and Node3, subscribing to T1 on the built-in partition. 
# Wait 3 seconds for historical data and then take all samples.
# \par \e Result
# All nodes have access to a complete set of samples (S1 + S2 + S3).
#
# \b Step \b 6
# \par \e Action
# Confirm all hosts agree on a single master for the default namespace
# \par \e Result
# Result Either Node1 is master of itself, Node2 and Node3, or Node2 is master of itself, Node1 and Node3, or Node3 is master of itself, Node1 and Node2
# 
# \b Step \b 7
# \par \e Action
# Stop OpenSplice and retrieve logfiles on both nodes
# \par \e Result
# OpenSplice and services are properly stopped on all nodes
