## \defgroup dds1615 DDS1615 - Configuration of preferred aligner
#
# \b Test \b ID: dds1615
# 
# \b Test \b Objectives: \n
# Verify the preferred aligner selection can be manipulated by placing nodes in a particular role. This is achieved by 
# publishing two sets of samples on two hosts in different roles. While these are the only hosts in their respective roles,
# they will select themselves as preferred aligner. Then a third host is started, in a role that matches one of the other hosts.
# Instead of selecting itself, it will select the host with matching role as its preferred aligner.
# Initial alignment takes place, resulting in a complete set of samples on the third host. The third host is then restarted,
# this time in the role that matches the other host. Behaviour is identical as it will again receive a complete set of samples
# through initial alignment, but this time from the other host. To confirm preferred aligner selections during the test behaved
# as expected the durability tracing logs are analyzed.
#
# \b Prerequisites, \b assumptions, \b constraints
#
# \par \e Environment:
# Three nodes are used in this test with an undisturbed method of communication,
# using the default OpenSplice (reliable broadcast channel) networking features.
#
# \par \e Invariant:
# Nodes A and B are running OpenSplice daemon with networking and durability services enabled on the default domain.
# The topic 'TestTopic' (T1) is used for this test, created with default QoS settings with the following exceptions: durability is set to transient, reliability is set to reliable.      
#
# \par \e Node \e 1:
# Configured to use RoleA. Publisher of a set of instances 0..9 (S1) of topic T1 on the default partition.
# \par \e Node \e 2:
# Configured to use RoleB. Publisher of a set of instances 10..19 (S2) of topic T1 on the default partition.
# \par \e Node \e 3:
# Initially inactive, started later on in the test.
# Configured to use RoleA but during the test the configuration is switched and OpenSplice restarted,
# placing the node in RoleB. Subscriber of topic T1 on the default partition.
#
# \b Test \b Procedure
#
# \b Step \b 1
# \par \e Action
# Start OpenSplice on node 1 (RoleA) and node 2 (RoleB)
# \par \e Result
# OpenSplice daemon and services is started on both nodes, nothing is written to error log.
#
# \b Step \b 2
# \par \e Action
# Create a DataWriter on node 1, write samples S1
# \par \e Result
# The datawriter completes the write operation without errors.
#
# \b Step \b 3
# \par \e Action
# Create a DataWriter on node 2, write samples S2
# \par \e Result
# The datawriter completes the write operation without errors.
#
# \b Step \b 4
# \par \e Action
# Start OpenSplice on node 3
# \par \e Result
# OpenSplice daemon and services are started on node 3. The node is placed in RoleA.
# Initial alignment is triggered when node 1 and node 2 are discovered.
#
# \b Step \b 5
# \par \e Action
# Create a DataReader on NodeC, subscribing to T1 on the default partition.
# Wait 3 seconds for historical data and then take as many samples as possible.
# \par \e Result
# Both sample sets S1 and S2 are read.
#
# \b Step \b 6
# \par \e Action
# Verify the preferred aligner selected by all three nodes
# \par \e Result
# Node 1 has selected itself as preferred aligner since node 3 is initially inactive and node 2 is in a different role,
# but aligns with node 2 since it is the only source of samples S2. Node 2 has selected itself as preferred aligner,
# since node 1 and node 3 are in a different role, but aligns with node 1 since it is the only source of samples S1.
# When started, node 3 selects node 1 as preferred aligner since they are in the same role, and receives S1+S2 by aligning with node 1.
#
# \b Step \b 7
# \par \e Action
# On node 3, restart OpenSplice with a different configuration that places the node in RoleB.
# \par \e Result
# The transient samples are lost on node 3 when OpenSplice is stopped. 
# The node is placed in RoleB when the OpenSplice daemon and services are started with the alternative configuration. 
# Initial alignment is triggered when node 1 and node 2 are discovered.
#
# \b Step \b 8
# \par \e Action
# Repeat step 5 + step 6
# \par \e Result
# The durability service has again aligned with the other nodes, making both sample sets S1 and S2 available on node 3.
# The preferred aligners have changed, this time node 3 selects and aligns from node 2 since they're both in RoleB.
#
# \b Step \b 9
# \par \e Action
# Stop OpenSplice and retrieve logfiles on all three nodes.
# \par \e Result
# OpenSplice and services are properly stopped on all nodes.
